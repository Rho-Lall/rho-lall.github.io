He does this by measuring the real cost of living in time, the time it takes to earn the money equivalent to the price of the goods.

A less benign corollary is that excessive regulation allows for government officers the opportunity to take bribes from those seeking a way around the regulation. Hernando De Soto\\u2019s documented study of opening a business in Peru revealed that it was impossible to start a business legally without bribes. The process was exhaustive and posed a significant barrier to entry in the Market.

De Soto reports that such situations result in $9 trillion in uncollateralized real property.

Wheelan doesn\\u2019t directly discuss why this issue persists.  There must be reasons, possibly such as protectionist logic or politics.  At the heart of the issue could be that if property is leveraged to incur debt it would be possible for foreign micro lenders to foreclose on the property in the case of default.  Clearly foreign investors would have an advantage.  Even with formal property rights land still belongs to government.  To illustrate lets assume that an owner of land in the US stops paying taxes on that land.  The property will be seized.  Data that would flesh this out would be valuable to De Soto.  Show the benefits through an analysis comparing the benefit to the risk.  Fundamentally the benefit must outweigh the risk because real property cannot be exported to another country. \\n\")), mdx(\"p\", null, \"CHALLENGING GDP AS A MEASURE OF OUR COLLECTIVE WELL-BEING\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"GDP is a good measure of a countries standard of living because it directly measures production.

It looked at several conclusions that Wheelan drew, specifically: GDP is a good measure of a countries standard of living because it directly measures production, GDP reflects more than just a number, excess government regulation leads to corruption, however, informal property rights hinder development.
