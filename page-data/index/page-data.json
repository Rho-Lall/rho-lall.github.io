Two thirds to 70% of the data is used for training the model. One third to 30% is saved for testing the model.

All else equal, small, well organized groups are more successful in the political process. It is easier for the countless masses to pay a few extra cents in taxes to benefit a relative few. Those few are highly motivated to protect that benefit, whereas the general population is largely unaware. As a result, \\u201Cthe democratic process will always favor small, well organized groups at the expense of large diffuse groups (p. 147 of Naked Economics Chapter 8).\\u201D In the case of ethanol, a $7 billion tax subsidy is gifted to a small group of farmers, less than 2% of the population. Meanwhile, the cost is spread over the remaining 98%, putting ethanol somewhere below good oral hygiene on our list of concerns. To put that into context for you, this subsidy amounts to $2 a month for every American.\\nIn countries where farming makes up a small fraction of the population, American and Europe, there are subsidies for agriculture. In countries where the farming population is relatively large, China and India, the subsides go the other way, forcing farmers to sell at below market prices.

These effects provide a theoretical explanation as to why the traditional choice model of constrained optimization does not fully explain the observable variability in crime across space and time.  Under the constrained optimization model, criminals seek to maximize utility given a fixed constraint such as civil and criminal penalties.  Criminals will commit crimes when the expected benefits exceed the expected costs (Becker 1968). Chang indicates that criminals look for easy opportunities; burglars prefer homes, large commercial buildings, or buildings with alleyway access over more closely guarded buildings (2011). This suggests that criminals consider costs and benefits and look to optimize benefits under risk constraints.  However, neighborhood demographics alone do not account for the variability in crime across time and space. Glaeser states, \\u201CPositive covariance across agents\\u2019 decisions about crime is the only explanation for variance in crime rates higher than the variance predicted by differences in local conditions\\u201D (Glaeser 1996, 508).

Peers can relax constraints by assisting directly or providing some technology or special knowledge that decreases a criminal\\u2019s likelihood of being caught (Glaeser 1996). Contagion effects involve copycats and retaliatory crimes as well (Jacob 2007). When peers\\u2019 actions influence a criminal\\u2019s decision to act there is a multiplier effect; the neighborhood\\u2019s actual crime rate will increase beyond a predicted crime rate based solely on neighborhood demographics (Glaeser 1996).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Hesseling explains the displacement effect as an inelastic demand for crime: \\u201Coffenders are flexible and can commit a variety of crimes; and the opportunity structure offers unlimited alternative targets\\u201D (Hesseling 1994, 220).

To determine these cutoff points, we identify the average neighborhood crime rate conditional on there being a murder, which is 7.5.

Clearly foreign investors would have an advantage.  Even with formal property rights land still belongs to government.  To illustrate lets assume that an owner of land in the US stops paying taxes on that land.  The property will be seized.  Data that would flesh this out would be valuable to De Soto.

(Mankiw 9)\\u201D He shows that if interest rates are too low then prices will rise but, GDP will \\u2018hit a wall\\u2019. (p. 170) This by definition is inflation. Wheelan draws several more conclusions, based on his second thesis.\\nThe first, conclusion is that the great depression was the result of botched monetary policy. The Fed did not intervene as the money supply dried up. Money was hoarded; banks failed and people lost confidence in the banking system. This meant that there were no deposits available for loans. (p. 186) Nobel Prize winner, Robert Mundell, argued that monetary policy in the 1920s led to the great depression, and by extension, the Nazi revolution and World War II. The reason, central banks choose to adhere to gold standard in light of the falling price of gold. They should have chosen a policy emphasizing price stability.  Thus, the severity of the Great Depression could have been reduced.\\nHis second conclusion, is that governments can cut their own debts by purposefully causing inflation. His argument is based on three logical points. First, governments often have large debt particularly when facing difficulties. Second, inflation favors debtors as it erodes that value of money they must pay back. Third, government controls the inflation rate. A small unstable government may deliberately cause inflation as a short term solution to buy time. (p. 182) This is not always the motivation. In 1980, US inflation climbed from 3%, in 1972, to 13.5%. Paul Volcker, lead the Fed to raise interest rates to 16%. This resulted in the recession of 1981-82, GDP shrunk by 3% and unemployment climbed to 10%. By 1983 inflation was back to 3%.

In this instance inflating the local currency would not affect their responsibility to this debt. It is rare that a country could secure a loan payable in their own currency.  Data that would further support this would be a breakdown of government debt and it\\u2019s debtors.\\nIn summary, this essay showed that governments can sometimes improve market outcomes (Mankiw 7), and that prices rise when the government prints too much money (Mankiw 9). It illustrated these principles using as examples: occupational licensing as encouraged by the teacher\\u2019s union, special interest group, since where we stand depends on where we sit, fouled monetary policy and the great depression, and Paul Volker\\u2019s anti inflationary monetary policy that lead to the recession of 1981.
