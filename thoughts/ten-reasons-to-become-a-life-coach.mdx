Imagine getting up in the morning excited about the day ahead. You have some quiet time and go out for a run on the beach. After breakfast, you sit out on the porch or in the backyard answering emails on your laptop and returning calls to your cell phone. In the morning you make coaching calls, thrilled about making a difference in your clients' lives.

In the afternoon, you take a leisurely lunch or go out to lunch with friends. You do a little marketing, business stuff, then take off to go hiking, biking, or out to the movies. You make your own schedule so you can go on your kid's field trip, volunteer to tutor a child, or help a friend.
