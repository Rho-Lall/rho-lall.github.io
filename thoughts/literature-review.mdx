This is my methodology / algorithm for completing a literature review on any given topic.

- I start with what is on Google Videos.
- I follow up with a visit to Wikipedia and a Google Search; it is a good idea to include “methodology” or “research methodology” in your search.
- Check out the ‘Annual Reviews’ Database at your local library website.
- Finally I gather articles from the the appropriate EBSCO hosted Journals and other sources.

I found the following video was helpful:
