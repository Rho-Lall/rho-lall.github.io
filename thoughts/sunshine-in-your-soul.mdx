I keep telling myself that I am going to start writing about “work related” management and team building. And here is another post that is going to appear to miss the mark, at least on the surface. I say that because team work (i hate to use the term management, but if i don’t it will not be clear that i am talking about leadership in management) is about building teams as much as it is about getting work done. You can’t do that with rose colored glasses.

[Elder Holland spoke](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung?lang=eng) during the Saturday afternoon session of conference. I resonated with [what he said](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung?lang=eng) because I feel this is the conversation we should be having.
