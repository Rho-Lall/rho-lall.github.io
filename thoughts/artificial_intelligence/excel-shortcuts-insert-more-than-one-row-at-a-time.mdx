## How to Quickly Insert multiple blank rows or columns in Excel.

To quickly insert multiple rows in Excel it makes more sense to use a mouse shortcut. You can insert multiple blank rows all at once with the following steps:

Step 1: Select the number of rows you want to insert.

Step 2: Right click the selected rows, and choose the Insert item in the context menu, see this video demonstration below:

Alternatively, you can insert one row (right click and select ‘insert’) and then press F4 as many times as you need. This works when you are too lazy to count rows.

## Did you know there are only a handful of tools that differentiate an excel expert from an intermediate user?

Yesterday my good friend said, “Anytime someone says they are an excel expert I know they don’t know anything.” I know where he is coming from. I have the same bias. As I learn a new tool in Excel I realize how much more there is to learn. But you don’t have to know how to use every tool to be an expert. When it comes to Excel, it really is possible to become an expert in a short amount of time because there are only about a half dozen areas where people get stuck, bottlenecks. Manipulating data is one area where cut, copy, and paste is just a portion. If you would like to access my (Rho Lall’s) full mind-map,  Become An Excel Expert, it covers all five areas. Just follow this link to my become an excel expert mind-map.
