I have two colleagues who have busted their behinds in the last few months to improve on areas where they were infamously bad. But if you asked around (like a survey) who is the worst? Their names are still at the top of the list!

That is because perceptions are hard to change. Perceptions are like averages in that respect. It doesn't matter how much improvement there is, all the front end poor performance is baked in. If you want to see the trends, you are better served with a moving average.
