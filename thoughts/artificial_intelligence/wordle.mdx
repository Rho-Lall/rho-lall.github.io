I have a new research toy.  This site will take any document (blog) and reduce it to it’s key themes.  I can think of several interesting applications for introspection and pre-reading documents.

This image is a wordle of my blog.  It is interesting that [“Bloomberg var”](https://web.archive.org/web/20150907220213/http://assume-wisely.blogspot.com/2011/02/financial-risk-analysis-from-bloomberg.html) (and any other financial term) doesn’t even make the list.

I think I might try this on a few of the academic articles I read to see what comes out of it.  Like I said, many interesting applications.
