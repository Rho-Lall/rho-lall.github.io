I am writing this as I watch the video for maybe the fourth or fifth time. I take issue with this first quote:

"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views, whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views." (McCrae, 1996).

That is hard for me accept. I like Applebee's. And yeah, I saw David's wiener before I appreciated his abs. So, no I don't want to eat at Chez-anything but does that mean I can't appreciate a "global community .... welcoming people from every discipline and culture who ... seek a deeper understanding of the world, and [who] hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all." (Ted, 2008)

I love TED. And **AND** I know a lot of conservatives who do too. As a matter of fact, a very right wing conservative shared this video with me. So? What about that? Well, as hard as it is to accept the "closed" label, I choose to (1) accept it's a real perception and (2) keep an open mind and awareness about that.

## Take the red pill, stay in Wonderland, and I’ll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

I love how he ties in the Matrix. First, I just love that movie. Second, he challenges this self-professed liberal audience to make a choice: stay in their blue liberal moral matrix or, swallow the red (republican) pill. I love how he uses the colors to tie politics in with the movie. But in this case the red pill is an invitation to think more . . . conservative. He is simultaneously linking and juxtaposing ideas. Very creative.

## The 5 Foundations of Morality

This is the core of the video. His research identifies how these five channels of morality play out in liberals and conservatives:

- Harm / Care
- Fairness / Reciprocity
- InGroup / Loyalty / Tribes
- Authority / Respect
- Purity / Sanctity

If you don’t already know where you stand, you can take the survey here, [www.YourMorals.org](http://www.yourmorals.org/). Liberals put a higher value on Harm/Fairness. Conservatives put slightly less value on Harm/Fairness but, they put equal weight into all five areas: harm, fairness, InGroup, Authority, and Purity. Liberals discount these last three significantly compared to conservatives. You could say that liberals have a two-channel morality while conservatives have a five-channel.

In our current context loyalty and tribalism gets a bad rap. I really appreciate the value he illustrates that comes from our ability to form groups and sub-groups.

The great conservative insight is that order is precious and it is really easy to lose.

## Can you handle the truth?

Liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute. According to Jonathan Hait, they form a balance on change VS stability. Yin & Yang don't hate each other. Once we understand this, then the path is open to leave our moral matrix.

> If you want the truth to stand clear before you. Never be for or against. The struggle between "for" and "against" is the mind's worst disease. ~ Sent-ts'an 700 CE

With that quote in mind, I’d really like to hear what you think. According to Jonathan Hait, liberals and conservatives form a balance on change VS stability. Do you agree? I don’t.
