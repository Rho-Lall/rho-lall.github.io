## My mom is good at:

Gardening. Creating peaceful spaces. And she can feel the emotions of people around her.

## My mom and I like to:

Go fishing . . . and steak.

## I love my mom because:

she is my mom.

This is a short documentary  about her work as a NYC park volunteer. She built a garden on a neglected strip of parkland. 

She volunteered with permission from the Parks Department . eventually her work, and  her larger-than-life personality, runs afoul of the bureaucracy. drama ensues. 

Mom is unforgettable.
