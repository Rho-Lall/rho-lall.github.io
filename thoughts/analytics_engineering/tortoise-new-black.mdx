I had the chance to dig into some data from Warby Parker as part of a combined project with Codecademy. 
I distilled data from several tables into a series of actionable insights about two of their marketing funnels. 
It was fun, for sure: “Any fool can complicate things. It takes genius to simplify them”, Albert Einstein.

A big takeaway from looking at the data is a preference for tortoise frames for both men and women. 
That preference was measurable in survey data as well as purchase data. 
When asked, women preferred tortoise to black with a 10% margin of error. 
Actual purchases confirmed this preference with a narrower margin of error, 5%.  Read here for [detail on my findings](https://www.slideshare.net/RhoLall/tortoise-is-the-new-black)
, and my [github repo](https://github.com/Rho-Lall/sql/tree/master/Warby%20Parker%20Codecademy%20-%20Tortoise%20IS%20The%20New%20Black).

Part of the project included a [code review from Codecademy](https://github.com/Rho-Lall/sql/issues/1). I am appreciative of the feedback. 
I often recommend Codecademy and have taken other courses from them as well.
