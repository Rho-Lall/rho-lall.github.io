If you haven't already, I highly recommend reading, "Managing Your Processes Using Averages May Be Hazardous to Your Company’s Health." from my ebook, Bull Doze Thru Bull. And if you have questions feel free to ask. Really.

Here are a couple additional power tips:

If you remove the top ten percent of a power curve you are left with . . . a power curve.

That means you can split power distributions into leagues. In middle school, for example, I was captain of the Jr. Varsity Soccer team. I could have played varsity (meaning I could have sat on the bench for the season). My coach knew I would rather play. I felt successful as captain because relative to my JV peers I outperformed. I was happier. I contributed more in the JV league then I would have in the varsity league. You can create similar results for your team.

Another point to consider, performance is dynamic. Take the time to find the areas where you outperform. Take the time to find the areas where your team member outperform. I'd rather have a team of out-performers that excel across a variety of areas than a team of individuals competing against each other in one narrow area.
