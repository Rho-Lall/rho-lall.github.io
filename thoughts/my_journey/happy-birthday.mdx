This might not be for everyone, but it is more likely for you since we are friends. I took up this challenge on my birthday and now I’m challenging you!

You might need some background. I don’t do New Year’s Resolutions. I haven't for about two years now. I do quarterly challenges, 90 days is a good time frame to make something happen. My birthday is the time to look ahead and ask myself, “What do I want my life to look like a year from now?”

On my Birthday I saw this video about becoming more productive, [The Truth About Working Hard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voCSkNjpVw0):

Hours at the office doesn't count, #mindBlown. How often do you hear people talk about how much time they spend at the office?

Now, he is a salesman. He talks about sales-ish activities. My activities look different. The big one for me is write everyday AND more importantly publish on a regular basis (three times a week). With that in mind, let me ask you,

“What do you want your life to look like a year from now?”

What activities will get you there? Let me know. And if I can help, let me know how.

My best.
