Changing the world begins with strengthening your own family. Elder D. Todd Christofferson has taught, “A major reason the Lord has a church is to create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the ‘strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life.’” He goes on to say, “This religion is not concerned only with self; rather, we are all called to serve. We are the eyes, hands, head, feet, and other members of the body of Christ.”Ask your Heavenly Father to show you those around you who need your help and to inspire you on how to best serve them. Heavenly Father may have placed those who need us closest to us, knowing that we are best suited to meet their needs. Remember that the Savior most often ministered to one person at a time.
