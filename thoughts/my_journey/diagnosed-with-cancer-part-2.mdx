My Dr. referred me to Dr. Amad two years ago, when I was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He ordered the PET scan. I asked why. His response chilled me: “Because I can’t look at your lungs with a sonogram.”

January 2016. It was curious that my endocrinologist, Dr. Amad, ordered a PET scan. Biopsy is a scary word the first time around, but not the second. Dr Amad took a couple of biopsies of lymph nodes in my neck. He said these could possibly explain the [rise in my Thyroglobulin](http://www.thyca.org/pap-fol/more/thyroglobulin), but he wasn’t convinced. My Dr. referred me to Dr. Amad two years ago, when I was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He ordered the PET scan. I asked why. His response chilled me: “Because I can’t look at your lungs with a sonogram.”



## Fact 1. Being diagnosed with thyroid cancer actually puts you at higher risk for other cancer.

I didn’t ask, “Why do you want to look at my lungs?” The answer was obvious. One cancer diagnosis didn’t mean I couldn’t have another. Can thyroid cancer spread to the lungs? I learned a thyroid cancer diagnosis actually puts you at [a 33% higher risk for other cancers](http://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/vol-7-issue-4/vol-7-issue-4-p-3-4). The PET scan revealed a 2 cm nodule nestled between my trachea, lung, and a major artery. I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in 2014. I could still have undiagnosed follicular thyroid cancer, which spreads to the lungs. Three different doctors recommended surgery to remove the mass.  

## Fact 2. Food for thought on holistic cancer treatment: Studies show that eating a diet consisting of 20% animal protein contributes to cancer growth.

March 2016. While  preparing for surgery, I came across some food for thought on holistic cancer treatment, [The China Study](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937856755&linkCode=as2&tag=aschinastudy-20&linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5). An experiment was originally conducted in 1968 by a pair of Indian scientists, TV Madhavan, & C. Gopalan: [The effect of dietary protein on carcinogenesis of aflatoxin](http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19721301150.html). Campbell built on their original experiment, replicating their results. Campbell showed that a 20% protein diet promotes cancer growth while a 5% protein diet shut it down. Campbell went on on to participate as a member of the China Study team. Praise for [The China Study](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937856755&linkCode=as2&tag=aschinastudy-20&linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5) is impressive:



>“The China Study describes a monumental survey of diet and death rates from cancer in more than 2,400 Chinese counties and the equally monumental efforts to explore its significance and implications for nutrition and health.”~ Frank Rhodes, PhD President Emeritus, Cornell University.

>The China Study is the most convincing evidence yet on preventing heart disease, cancer, and other Western diseases by dietary means. ~ Junshi Chen MD, PhD Senior Research Professor, Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety – Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.

>The China Study is a well-documented analysis of the fallacies of the modern diet, lifestyle and medicine and the quick fix approach that often fails. The lessons from China provide compelling rationale for a plant based diet to promote health and reduce the risk of the diseases of affluence. ~ Sushma Palmer, PhD Former Executive Director, Food & Nutrition Board – U.S. National Academy of Sciences.

This research gives me food for thought. There is complexity to eating that extends beyond nutrition. I don’t pretend to understand that complexity. There is a social side, illustrated by this quote from Samuel L Jackson:  “[How can I trust a man who won’t eat a good old-fashioned American hotdog?](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010673/quotes)” There is a emotional side. We use food as a drug. We use foods to treat ourselves; we treat ourselves to ice cream. Thoracic surgery provided me some clarity, I don’t want to do that again. For now, I’ll have that hotdog, but I don’t need one every day. [I bought The China Study](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937856755&linkCode=as2&tag=aschinastudy-20&linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5). I’m reading it now.
