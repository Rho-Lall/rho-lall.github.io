The fires in your life can threaten, frighten and sometimes burn. But God promises you peace as you incline your heart to Him. Your joy will not be diminished. You will not be abandoned or forgotten.“

Trust in the Lord with all thine heart,” the scriptures teach, “and lean not unto thine own understanding. In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”

Heed the call: seek God, pray, believe, and walk the Savior's prepared path—even if you stumble at times—be assured that “all things shall work together for your good.”

God “gives strength to the weary and increases the power of the weak.”“Though the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.”
