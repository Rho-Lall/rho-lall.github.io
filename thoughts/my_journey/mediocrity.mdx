>"If you watched a movie about a guy who wants a Volvo and worked for years to get it, you wouldn’t cry at the end when he drove off the lot. . . 

>You wouldn’t tell your friends. . . Or go home listen to some music and ponder the lessons of the story.



>The truth is, you wouldn’t remember that movie a week later. . . Nobody cries at the end of a movie about a guy who wants a Volvo.

>But we spend our years actually living those stories, and expect our lives to feel meaningful. . . if, what we choose to do with our lives won’t make a story meaningful, it won’t make a life meaningful either."

> ~ Donald Miller, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years.

Is the Volvo the issue? What if it was a Challenger Hellcat? A Tesla? I believe that meaning isn't found in owning a car. But Patrick Bet-David counters that idea in less than 2 minutes. He uses a sports car as a symbol that speaks to success. Patrick says most people only pay attention to the finished product. Most people focus on the car. Donald Miller is guilty of focusing on the car. Losers focus on winners and what winners drive. Winners focus on winning. In the end, your success will speak for itself.

Start with focus.
