Business intelligence reporting is the process of transforming data into insights that add value to the business. It helps business leaders make data-driven decisions, which in turn leads to better customer experiences, optimized churn rates, and accelerated growth. There are two distinct services involved in business intelligence reporting: curated content and self-service.

## The Advantages of BI Reporting 

Making business decisions based on data rather than intuition or guesswork can lead to a better outcome for your business. Data-driven decision-making allows you to use actual information rather than a hunch or best guess to make choices about how to move your business forward. This can be especially helpful when it comes to areas like marketing, where making the wrong choice can mean losing customers and revenue.

Data-driven decision-making is also important when it comes to reducing churn. If you can identify which customers are most likely to leave, you can take steps to prevent them from doing so. Additionally, using data to make decisions about product development can help you create products that are more in line with what your customers want.

Overall, using data rather than intuition or guesswork to make business decisions can lead to better outcomes for your company.


## How BI Reporting Drives Data-Driven Decision Making 

Most business leaders are faced with the challenge of dealing with too much data. Data is more and more ubiquitous, it's too much to sift through when making important decisions. Leaders do not have the time to sort through all of the data themselves in order to find the insights they need.

Business intelligence reporting is the process of transforming data into insights that add value to the business. It helps business leaders make data-driven decisions, which in turn leads to better customer experiences, optimized churn rates, and accelerated growth. BI reporting encompasses two distinct services: curated content and self-service. 

The first service is a curated collection of assets such as data composition requests (csv data dumps), reports, and dashboards. Most decision-makers want to consume curated content. They don't want to build it themselves. The second service is providing an experience where business leaders can self-serve and dive into the data to answer questions at the speed of business. These two needs are at odds. There is data that needs to be right. There is data that needs to be right . . . now.

In order to do this, business intelligence reporting requires governance and processes to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and scalable. This means ensuring a single source of truth that is consistent across different departments and platforms. This can be important when you are expanding your business and need to make sure that all of your data is aligned.

Business intelligence reporting helps business leaders focus on the business rather than on data management. By providing business leaders with curated content and self-service experiences, business intelligence reporting allows them to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently. 

## Trend Reports
Business intelligence reporting can help business leaders identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent when looking at raw data.

A trend report is a type of business intelligence report that helps business leaders identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent when looking at raw data. Trend reports can help business leaders make decisions about where to allocate resources in order to capitalize on current trends and avoid potential pitfalls.

When creating a trend report, it is important to consider the time frame that the report covers. Is the trend increasing or decreasing? What is the direction of the trend? Is it linear or exponential? What is the cause and effect relationship between different factors?

It is also important to use graphs and visuals to help business leaders understand the data. Trends are often difficult to spot when looking at raw data, but can be easily identified when presented in a graphical format.

Trend reports can be helpful for business leaders in all industries, but they are especially useful for businesses in fast-paced industries like technology and retail. By staying ahead of the curve, business leaders in these industries can ensure that they are not left behind.

## Comparative Analysis (Comps)
Comparative analysis reports are business intelligence reports that compare two or more data sets. They can be used to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.

There are several different types of comparative analysis reports. The most common type is a side-by-side comparison report. This report compares two sets of data head-to-head. It can be used to identify which data set is larger, which data set is more recent, or which data set is more accurate. A common comparison is to compare a previous period in time, last year, last quarter, or last week.

A waterfall report is another type of comparative analysis report. This report compares multiple data sets and identifies how each data set relates to the others. It can be used to track changes in data over time or to identify relationships between different factors.

Comparative analysis reports can be helpful for business leaders in all industries, but they are especially useful for businesses that operate in multiple geographies. By comparing data from different markets, businesses can identify trends and patterns that may not be apparent when looking at data from a single market.


##How to Create a BI Report 
When it comes to business intelligence reporting, one of the most important aspects is the quality of the data. In order to ensure that data is accurate and relevant, business intelligence reporting requires a certain level of governance and processes.

When it comes to business intelligence reporting, one of the most important aspects is the quality of the data. In order to ensure that data is accurate and relevant.

One way to achieve this is by using a layered approach to development. This approach divides  data processing into multiple layers, each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the development process.

In software development, the data layer is responsible for developing and managing the data that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes collecting data from various sources, cleansing and transforming the data, and loading the data into a database.

The business layer is responsible for developing the logic that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes developing algorithms and formulas, creating queries, and building reports and dashboards.

The presentation layer is responsible for developing the user interface that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes designing screens, setting up navigation, and creating buttons and controls.

By using a layered approach, business intelligence reporting can be effectively managed and maintained. The layers work together to ensure that data is accurate and relevant, and that business leaders have the information they need to make informed decisions.


## Tips for Using BI Reporting Effectively

Business intelligence reporting can be a powerful tool for business leaders, but it is not effective unless it is used correctly. Here are a few tips for using business intelligence reporting effectively:

- Make sure the data is accurate and relevant.
- Use a layered approach to development.
- Follow best practices for data governance.
- Use business intelligence reports to make informed decisions.

With business intelligence reporting in place, companies can trust the data they are working with to make informed decisions.
