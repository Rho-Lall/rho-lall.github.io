Become a catalyst for change. 
Others might be intimidated by new knowledge, fear what they don’t understand.  
But we can calm those fears and discover new understanding because we are willing to soak it in. Because we crave discovery. 
Think into the deep.

I'm trying to give my why form. It might be easier to draw the wind. The best I can do is is offer evidence it exists. I can’t articulate an answer, but I know it is there because I am inspired when I come to work and I am fulfilled when I leave.

I wrote that a few months ago. I finished Simon Sinek's Start with Why. Twice. I look back at the progress I've made. I’ve been working on something that I find inspiring. A mantra like 
Elliot Hulse’s “[Becoming the strongest version of yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L241i4qX70M)
.” Or Eric Thomas’ “[When you want to succeed as badly as you want to breath, then you will succeed](https://youtu.be/5fsm-QbN9r8?t=22)
.” The best I’ve got is, “Think into the deep thought.” 

It’s not intuitively clear. I suspect the vagueness is just cover for a thought that is still not clearly articulated. The idea is steeped in the idea that deep thought can only happen for a mind that is focused on the present. I’m all about deep thoughts. I ask myself, to what end? For the love of learning falls flat. The truth is because I want to learn. I want to know. It’s really just a fancy, enlightened way to say in my best Forrest Gump voice, “I like to learn a lot”. 

Tonight I broke through to the next level of clarity. Tonight I wrote:

> “Become a catalyst for change. Others might be intimidated by new knowledge, fear what they don’t understand.  But we can calm those fears and discover new understanding because we are willing to soak it in. Because we crave discovery. Think into the deep.”

I’m getting there.
