Projects fail, not people.  When I get a project I am relentless about making things happen.  It is hard (but necessary) to admit when things aren’t happening; no one wants to drown a puppy.  That is what it feels like some times.

Patrick Pichette on optimizing human infrastructure to deal with failed projects:

>The people on the project know that it is failing – as senior management you have to say, “Let’s declare failure – let’s get the champagne and kill this puppy.  Then we can put you on stuff that’s really cool and sexy.”

My thoughts.  Embodied in this approach is an understanding that projects fail, not people.  When I get a project I am relentless about making things happen.  It is hard (but necessary) to admit when things aren’t happening; no one wants to drown a puppy.  That is what it feels like some times.

Cheers.
