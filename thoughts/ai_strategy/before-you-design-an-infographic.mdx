What's it for?

A graph only exists to make a point. Its purpose is not to present all the information. Its purpose is not to be pretty. Most of all, its purpose is not, "well, they told me I needed to put a graph here."

The purpose of a graph is to get someone to say "a-ha". Whether the graph helps them see something the way you do, or helps them see a truth neither of you could have seen before.

You must get to "a-ha".

Begin there and work backwards.
