Today I began working on the financials of my first company analysis. 
I was up till 3:30 in the morning downloading reports from the SEC and going over the companies financial sets. 
If that wasn’t enough my professor provided me with a list of his favorite 350 financial ratios. 
So while he is off running a marathon this weekend I will be working on my own marathon of sorts.
