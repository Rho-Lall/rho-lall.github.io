~~Change, real change, is the result of focused persistence.~~

~~It's easy to get a bunch of people sort of excited for a little while.~~

~~The challenging part, and the reason that change doesn't happen as often as it should is that we get distracted. Today's urgent is more urgent than yesterday's important.~~

~~The concept of breaking news and the crisis of the day proves my point. If the world ended every time Wolf Blitzer implied it would, we would have been toast a long time ago. The organizations that actually change things are the ones that have a time horizon that's longer than 36 hours.~~

~~There are very few overnight successes. Very few entrepreneurs, freelancers, non-profits, candidates, spiritual leaders, activists or people in a successful relationship that got there with thunder and lighting. It happens with a drip.~~

PS this post is intentionally disfigured in honor of [Break the Internet](https://www.battleforthenet.com/breaktheinternet/). I'm annoyed that we have to continually fight this fight, but it just proves my point. Drip by drip.
