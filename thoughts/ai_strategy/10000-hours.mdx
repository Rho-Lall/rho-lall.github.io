10,000 hours is five years at a full time job.

No doubt on pursuing continuous improvement as a lifelong endeavor. But along the way let's knock out competent.

You don’t have 10,000 hours to learn something new. 

"I am never going to have free time ever again." I wrote that on about month two of being a new parent. I love learning. The more I learn, the more I need to learn. The more books I read, the more books I need to read. And so my conflict came to a head. Where am I going to find the time?

So we’ve all heard that it takes 10,000 hours to acquire a new skill. If you want to be good, 10k hours. That's the same as working a full time job for five years. That's a lot.

But the research that determined that bar of 10,000 hours is based on the goal to become world-class, like a gold medal Olympian. 

No doubt pursuing continuous improvement is a lifelong endeavor. But along the way I think i'll knock out competent. And for some things competent is good enough.
