Most of what we do at work all day is one of these three.

**Fun:** It's engaging, it gives us satisfaction, people smile.

**Urgent:** Someone else (or perhaps we) decided that this paper is on fire and it has to be extinguished before anything else happens.

**Induced by Fear:** Most common of all, the things we do to protect ourselves from the fear we'd have to sit with if we didn't do them.

Not on this list: important.

Steven Covey's 2x2 matrix is really helpful in understanding what do do with urgent VS important work. Urgent usually gets handled. 
Then we spend our time on not-urgent & not-important as a way to reward ourselves.

A day spent doing important work is rare. And precious.

It can only happen on purpose.
