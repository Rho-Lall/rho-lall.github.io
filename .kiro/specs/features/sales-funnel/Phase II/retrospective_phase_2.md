# Retrospective

## Phase 2

This was actually done as a separate project because it involves setting up a back in server to support a lead-capture form.

This phase included these projects:

✅ Fix Blog MDX Content - support/mdx-rendering-fix (2025-11-02)
✅ Replace Mockup Form - components/active-form-deployment (2025-10-30) 
✅ Sales Funnel Pages - features/sales-funnel (2025-10-28)
✅ Repository Documentation - architecture/start (2025-10-25)

This took longer than i originally thought it would. But that is also because life became busy. It's like everything conspired against me to stop me from moving forward. I litterally plodded forward one slow step at a time.

Never mind, this consisted entirely of a stack of tools that I had never really used in this way: terraform, API gateway, Lambdas (well maybe some Lambdas). Oh, and I did the whole thing in JavaScript.

I launched into an entirely new spec and completely forgot I had planned future phases for the sales funnel. I was into the design stage when I remembered that I had done this before, but maybe hadn't saved it? While organizing my spec folder I found the original spec. Now I'm returning to the project as originally planned.
