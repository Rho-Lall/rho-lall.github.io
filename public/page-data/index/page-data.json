Revenue, retention, response times. No dips. No drama. You breathe easier.  \nYou feel informed. In control. Ready.\n\nBut when was the last time your dashboard actually *prevented* a problem instead of just *showing* you one?\n\nThat’s the illusion. Visibility feels like clarity, but it isn’t.  \nOrganizations spend millions on dashboards believing that seeing more data equals controlling more outcomes.\n\nThe math doesn’t add up.\n\n## The Visibility Trap\n\nBusiness leaders and plenty of data professionals confuse *visibility* with *clarity*.\n\nA dashboard shows everything measurable, but without context you end up understanding nothing that truly matters.\n\nPicture this: your customer acquisition cost spikes 40%. The dashboard screams red. But it can’t tell you *why*.\n\nIs marketing testing new channels?  \nIs sales chasing enterprise deals?  \nOr is your product-market fit quietly deteriorating?\n\nYou can see the symptom. The cause remains elusive.\n\nReactive management based on dashboards keeps you perpetually behind the curve, managing consequences instead of influencing causes.\n\nAnd as the dashboards multiply, something else happens.  \nThe data thickens. Every department breathes its own version of truth.  \nEveryone’s busy. But no one sees clearly.\n\nThat’s *organizational smog*. The haze created when visibility outpaces understanding. You think you’re watching reality, but you’re really watching the fog swirl.\n\n![](https://cdn.marblism.com/51AQEY1I1IE.webp)\n\n## Why Smart People Build Dumb Systems\n\nIf dashboards were the answer, we’d all be geniuses.\n\nThe explosion of dashboards inside most companies isn’t a sign of control it’s evidence of fragmentation.\n\nEach new dashboard appears when someone, somewhere, needs their own lens into the chaos. The sprawl mirrors how knowledge is scattered across silos, roles, and shifting priorities.\n\nMost dashboards start with *available data*, not with the *workflow being monitored*. Metrics get aggregated because they can be not because the combination creates understanding.\n\nThis leads to what researchers call **metric myopia**: when what gets measured starts to matter more than what actually moves the business.\n\nIt’s Goodhart’s Law in action: once a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n\nDashboards make you feel accountable, but they show performance without improving it.\n\n## More Data, Less Direction\n\nI watched this play out with a marketing team that was drowning in sophistication.  \nDozens of dashboards. Real-time feeds. Attribution models stacked on attribution models.\n\nThe new CMO inherited all of it and still couldn’t get a straight answer to basic questions.  \nWhat was the cost to acquire a customer? Basic.  \nEveryone had data, but no one had clarity.  \nThere were sixteen different ways to measure conversion. Seventeen opinions on which one was right.\n\nWe weren’t missing data. We were missing alignment.\n\nSo I applied my four-step clarity framework:\n\n1. Find what’s working and keep it.  \n2. Find what’s broken and fix it.  \n3. Find what’s missing and fill the gap.  \n4. Delete the rest.\n\nDelete is a strong word. But when you go in intending to delete, you get attention. It taps into fear of loss and creates buy-in fast.  \nMore importantly, deletion forces focus. Clutter dilutes truth.\n\nThat’s when progress began, not because we added dashboards, but because we removed the noise that pretended to be insight.\n\n## How I Deliver Results\n\nDashboards tell you what happened.  \nCapability tells you what to do next.\n\nThe solution is **decision architecture**: building a business model that considers data a first class asset.\n\n**Expert Systems → Data Engineering → Analytics and Reporting →**   \n**→ Machine Learning → Knowledge Graphs →**   \n**→ Multi Agent Systems → Simulations & AI Twins**\n\nThis is the shift from visibility to clarity, from information to intelligence.\n\nDecision architecture spans that entire spectrum. It’s the connective layer that turns data operations into AI foundations, and AI foundations into adaptive, learning organizations.\n\n## Start with Decisions, Not Data\n\nMost analytics teams start with the question they need to answer.  This is a trap.\n\nDon’t start with the question. Start with the workflow.  \nUntil you understand the motion of the work, what triggers action, what defines success you’re just painting symptoms.\n\n![](https://cdn.marblism.com/6CTTAvvI3y9.webp)\n\n## Why Seeing Everything Still Leaves You Blind\n\nClarity means understanding *causes*, *context*, and *what to do when things change.*  \nVisibility is a shadow of clarity it only shows the symptoms.\n\nReal clarity happens when people agree not just on what the numbers say, but on what they mean and what they’ll do when they move.\n\nThat’s when dashboards fail. They collect everything and clarify nothing.\n\nClarity is subtractive. It’s ruthless.  \nYou can’t fix complexity you can only simplify what works and evolve from there.\n\n## Stop Measuring Performance and Start Engineering It\n\nMost reporting exists to make executives feel good about themselves. It gives the illusion of control while hiding the real problems.\n\nIn my data engineering work, we design pipeline alerts that don’t just say “job failed.”  \nThey name the failing script, tell you how to triage, and if that doesn’t work, who to call and what to say.\n\nA single message triggers the right action no dashboard required.\n\nThat’s capability: embedding decision logic into workflows so the right person gets the right instruction at the right time.\n\n![](https://cdn.marblism.com/WNHQZ3mCPN_.webp)\n\n## When Systems Fail, Culture Decides What Happens Next\n\nToo often, “culture” gets the blame for failures.  \n“Our culture isn’t ready.” Culture is often a scapegoat.\n\nBut culture isn’t the blocker. It’s the opportunity.\n\nSomewhere along the way, culture became a synonym for *what we do when we’re not working*: lunches, events, offsites, perks.  \nIn reality, culture is *how we work together when the pressure is on.*\n\nCulture decides what happens when systems break, how context gets communicated, and which choices people make by instinct.  \nIt’s the foundation of clarity. The shared memory of how things have worked (and failed).\n\nThat is why your Subject Matter OG is so valuable. He isn’t just a veteran; he’s a living archive of undocumented culture.  A human system that holds everything your dashboards can’t see.\n\n## Decision Engines, Not Dashboards\n\nDecision architecture will define the business model of the AI era. Companies that win next won’t have the most dashboards they’ll have the best systems for turning data into decisions.\n\nThey’re shifting from analyzing data to operationalizing it, embedding intelligence directly into how work gets done.\n\nThat means fewer dashboards and more **systems that act**: automated triggers, guided decisions, and continuous learning loops.\n\nThis is how intelligent enterprises evolve:\n\n**Expert Systems → Data Engineering → Analytics & Reporting → Machine Learning → Knowledge Graphs → Multi-Agent Systems → Simulations & AI Twins.**\n\nEach stage builds on the same foundation; treating data as a **first-class asset**, not the by-product of operations.\n\nDecision architecture is what connects those stages. Decision architecture makes the implicit explicit. It codifies how your organization thinks: the culture, the craft, the instincts. So intelligence compounds and scales instead of walking out the door at the end of the day.\n\n## The Moment Clarity Turns Into Leverage\n\nMoving past dashboard dependency starts with recognizing that information architecture shapes behavior.\n\nSystems that emphasize monitoring create reactive cultures.  \nSystems that emphasize prediction and action create proactive ones.\n\nThe organizations that win will treat data as a first-class asset one designed to improve decision quality, not dashboard volume.\n\nStart small.  \nPick the three most important decisions your team makes every week.  \nMap how those decisions happen, what slows them down, and what information would accelerate them by 50%.\n\nThen redesign those workflows so the right decision happens naturally, not manually. ( Not another dashboard =)\n\nClarity isn’t abstract. It shortens the distance between knowing and doing.  \nBecause when the doing happens faster, the organization learns faster.  \nBut as learnings compound, control stops feeling reactive and becomes effective.\n\nThat’s where clarity becomes control.\n\nQuestions to ponder:\n\nWhat's one critical workflow that delivers value?  \nWhat would change instantly if it operated with relentless clarity?\n\nWhere do decisions stall because only you see the full picture?\n\nWhere does organizational smog still linger in your company?  \nWhat would it take to clear it?"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"August 11, 2025","title":"Don’t have 10,000 hours to learn something new?","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nCompetence takes 20 hours.

It's saturday afternoon, I’m unloading groceries. I don't remember what set me off, I just remember chucking a giant Costco package of toilet paper across my lawn in the general direction of my front door. I'd had it.\n\nI was tired. Tired of being broke. Tired of all the crap in my life. Too much nagging. Not enough sex. Too much weight. Not enough exercise. Too much work. Not enough results. Too much month at the end of the money. And my kids...my only reason to endure, were killing me.\n\nI dreaded the weekend. Another reminder of how much my life sucked. At least when I went to work, I could focus on work and take my mind off things. Monday mornings were the worst: the inevitable question, what did I do over the weekend? The truth is, I spent my weekends simmering, waiting for Monday because we were broke. I couldn't afford to do anything.\n\nMy wife's had it too. \"It's never enough,\" she says, \"You're never happy.\" My wife is tired. Tired of seeing me like this. She is right of course. I keep repeating the same line: the idea that when I graduate college, get my first job, get a new job, make a certain amount of money . . . then I'll be happy. But that isn't true at all! I keep moving the goalposts because each step doesn't make me happier, it just frustrates me more that I am not where I want to be.\n\nI didn't know it but I was suffering from shouldy values.\n\n## The Hole We All Need to Climb Out Of\nShouldy values is what I call our default setting: focusing on what should be, what I should have had by now. There is one in particular: Big house. Nice car. I didn't even want that big a house, just bigger. I didn't even want that nice a car, just nicer. In the absence of actual values those shouldy values end up as a fairly common default:\n<br/>\n\n> What's it all for? Tour bus, studio, and the fans, \n\n> What's it all for? Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims,\n\n> What's it all for? To feed my family and my friends,\n\n> What's it all for? To change your world the best I can.\n\n> [What's It All For](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEk_XPY1sSg), Bazaar Royal\n<br/>\n\nAcknowledging these shouldy values is the important first step. It isn't the same as discovering the valuable ones. How is this discovery achieved? For me it was [a long process](/thoughts/values-2015) of figuring things out as I went along. It's not learning something new; It's simply remembering what you already know.  \n\nDiscovering values is an art. It's creative expression. It isn't additive, like molding clay. It's subtractive, like carving into stone. You're looking to unearth something under the surface that's been there all along. Don't try to create new values; all you can truly do is expose the real ones.\n\n## The Transformative Power of Strong Company Values\nA community that can clearly identify its values emits an attractive force. Values are inherently fuzzy. We're all seeking them in some form. It's natural to want to participate in something larger than yourself. Such a community pulls you in.\n\nThis is matter of course in religious communities where values are taught as part of the tenets of faith. By no means is it exclusive to religious organizations. When I wasn't simmering on the weekends, I worked at Entrata. Entrata is exceptional in living its values. Entrata is a fun place to work. It’s one of the company values: business in the front, party in the back. We worked hard, we played hard. It was easy to adopt Entrata’s values as my own. It was easy to resonate with them.\n\nWhen values are clear it creates trust. It creates a common ground you can build on. It builds the foundation of a relationship.\n\nEntrata modeled for me how to live intentionally and not by default. I needed to see that. It gave me permission to do likewise. It prodded me to discover my own values. To turn the default setting off.\n\n## The Mistake That Is Costing You\nTake a look at your resume. Where is the emphasis? Is it on your accomplishments? Take a look at what you wrote in your last performance evaluation. Do you concentrate on your actions? Consider the last excellent movie you saw. What can you tell me about it?\n\nDon't give away the plot! Focusing on the 'what' is a temptation everyone falls prey to.\n\nInstead, start with \"Why.\" Simon Sinek wrote a book on it, but you can get away with just watching his TED talk.\n\n[![Start With Why](./media/content/start_with_why_video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4)\n\nAnyone (and everyone) can tell you what they do.  \n\nSome can talk about how. This is 90% of what marketers will focus on: differentiating value proposition, proprietary process, secret sauce, or USP.  \n\nVery few discuss the importance of Why, Purpose, Cause, Belief. These are crucial to consider. Why do you wake up every day? More importantly, why should anyone care? People don't buy what you do--they buy why you do it. Your product simply serves as proof of what you believe.  \n\nThe goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. It is not making money; that is a result.  \n\nStart with Why, then follow it up with How and What.\n\n## How to Start with Why\nI bought [Start With Why](https://amzn.to/3Tmc3HF) hoping to learn how. The book comes up short on teaching how. The book focuses on why it matters and at the end, Simon upsells his $100 course to help you find your why. I opted to figure it out on my own. It took a little over a year to nail down a repeatable process. But it was free! If you are interested in learning how I did it, keep reading.\n\nIt can be tough to figure out your Why. It's innately fuzzy and [hard to pin down](/thoughts/values-2015). Your goal is to bring it into sharp focus. That might take some time. Keep revisiting the idea, and you'll get there.\n\nMy initial efforts were strongly influenced by the [Strengths Finder 2.0 Assessment](https://amzn.to/3KqROVx). I strongly recommend this assessment; it's free when you buy [Strengths Finder 2.0](https://amzn.to/3KqROVx). This is a fantastic tool for determining your natural talents to set you apart from the crowd. Strengths are your USP, your secret sauce. This task is well worth your time. Even as I studied my talents I was keenly aware that I was missing the mark. Strengths speak to your How not your Why. Strengths aren't the same as purpose.\n\nIt's ironic that the question Simon Sinek leaves unanswered in his TED talk is answered by another TED talk: How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes by Adam Leipzig.\n\n[![How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes](./media/content/life_purpose_video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M)\n\nThe term \"elevator pitch\" is something you're undoubtedly familiar with. Adam goes through a series of questions to help you articulate yours in under five minutes: your own elevator pitch that starts with why. You can check out mine on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rholall/). Or my [Instagram Bio](https://www.instagram.com/rho_lall/).\n\nThis is starting with Why. This is real progress. This is material accomplishment. This is . . . not enough. This is not going to weather the storm.\n\nMake no mistake the storm comes.\n\n## The Cure For Shouldy Values\nThis excecise will help you identify those values that will weather the storms. You are going to fill out [a bracket for your values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing). Think March Madness, but with values.\n\nThis is most easily done using Post-It notes. I've started you off with [a pretty good list of values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing). Look for ideas in this list, or simply google \"list of values.\" On a post-it notes, write down the values that appeal to you. One value per Post-It. If a term attracts your attention, note it down on a post-it. Don't edit yourself at this step.\n\nCreate these five categories: relationships, things, talents, traits, and skills. You should already have a stack of Post-it notes on hand. Sort your notes into these categories. Don't overlook this step. I had to start over. In the last step, it will become obvious why this is significant.\n\nFinally, fill out your bracket. Hold a tournament for each category (think March Madness). Each value will compete against another. Consider a pair of values. If you have to pick one, which do you keep? The winner advances. Repeat until there is a clear winner for each category. You can repeat the process to determine second place and so on until your values are ranked for each category.\n\nThe categories are crucial because you might prioritize one category over another. This was my experience: even though I highly value knowledge, values in other categories killed it off simply because knowledge is a thing. I value things the least. I realized the need for categories when I saw knowledge dropping deep down in the ranking. Play with it, flex the bracket to meet your needs. The bracket is designed to spark your own intuition. It's not intended as an objective measure.\n\n## Knowing Your Values Can Help You With Tough Decisions\n\nWhen my wife and I have a disagreement we have a few options:\n\n- Concede. My go-to. For most things, it just doesn't matter.\n- Persist. Endure. Bully. Until the other person concedes.\n- Compromise. No one gets what they want.\n- Leverage our common values.\n\nWe can choose the last option to take a step back. Remember who we are and what we value. Elevate the discussion to a higher plane. Approach our discussion from a position of common ground. Ask, \"What do people like us who hold these values do in this situation?\" Leverage our values to make the decision.\n\n## Values are a tool of effective leadership.\n\nIn a world where the only certainty is change, values-based leadership is more important than ever. In order to navigate through the constant uncertainty and chaos, organizations need leaders who can make decisions based on enduring values, not short-term pivots.\n\n![Where Have All the Good Men Gone](./media/content/where_have_all_the_good_men_gone.png)\n\nWhat does it mean to be a values-based leader in the modern age? What do values do for an organization? And how you can use them to navigate the challenges of modern business?\n\nValues afford leaders the leverage they need so they don't have to be present in every meeting (and for every decision). Values create leverage for thinking and decision-making. It's important to recognize the role values play in leadership and decision-making. What do I mean?\n\nIn a business context values become a tool. Values are the foundational data your tribe has available to make informed decisions. They are the fundamental building block that drives everything else in the org.\n\n  \n\n## Developing Company Values\n\nEntrata continuously invests in its values, it's not a one-time thing. It starts with interviews--my friend told me that they would ask about the company's values. They did. Every week, we encouraged each other to live up to these values. \"Talk to me Goose\", TTMG, was a common shorthand for communication as was \"Be Excellent\" to .... our customers ... each other, etc. Values were on display at Values Week as well as other company events. Each year during our annual review, we addressed how well we lived up to the Entrata values.\n\nI said before Entrata is a fun place to work: business in the front, party in the back. The symbol of that particular value is the mullet. At Entrata the conference rooms are named after famous mullets: there is Aggassi, Norris, Bolton, and Cyrus just to name a few. Walk into Norris and the large display monitor has a screensaver featuring . . . Chuck Norris. That's cool. That's fun.\n\nComing to Purple Innovation I see a similar theme to our conference rooms. Instead of famous mullets, Purple's conference rooms are named after scientists: Da Vinci, Tesla, Edison. It's not listed as one of our values, but \"Thanks Science!\" is a popular phrase Purple uses for swag and social media. Science isn't expressly stated in our current values; it underlies several of them. As a data professional, that is attractive. I believe in science, I invest in knowledge.\n\n  \n\n## Tell Me Your Story.\n\nLeaders provide stability in an unstable environment and inspire teams to achieve great things. Embrace values-based leadership to create a culture of trust in your organization, your tribe, from employees to shareholders, better decision-making, greater creativity, and innovation.\n\nWe all forget. We all need to be reminded of our purpose. Jamie Dimon once said,\n\n<br/>\n\n> \"Leadership is relentless storytelling.\" \n<br/>\n\nTell me your story. Do the work, what story is yours to tell? It's a story about you, your tribe, and what you do for them. It starts with what you believe, and what you value. But it can't just be about you. Your story is about what you do to help your tribe reach their ideal, achieve their goals, and overcome their trials. You need to be clear about who you are, what you believe, and how you stand out. You need to be clear so you can communicate with your tribe. How else will they know? When you share your values it will resonate with them. They will be better for it.\n\nThis is your contribution, what you do to serve them.\n\n\n## PS: Memory Lane\nI don't do this with all my blogs but this one is hard won and special to me.

Ashen faces, gray matted hair and clothes: the dead appeared to rise up from the subway. They came in waves.\n\nIn 2001 I was an adult, but just barely. I had just arrived home from living abroad and needed a job. There was this new thing called the internet. I could search for jobs without having to leave my apartment. My mom was not impressed. She didn’t care. If she was outside, I needed to be outside. I could apply online but when I was done I needed be outside looking for work and not come back until after she was home. I remember that fight; it was September 10th.\n\nThe next morning, I made phone calls and faxed out my resume. The jobs were posted online, but I still had to fax my resume to most of them. I prepared to make my way out the door. My dad called in a panic. He asked for my mom! He asked for my sister! He wanted to know where they were. He wanted to know if they were okay.\n\n“Why?\" I asked. \"What's going on?”\n\n“You don't know, turn on the television.”\n\nI turned on the TV and asked, “What channel?”\n\nDad never answered.\nIt didn't matter. \n\nAt that point, my experience is probably quite common. I see tower one smoking. I see the plane hit tower two. From my apartment, I can't see the World Trade Center. I can’t hear the buildings collapse.\n\nWhen the jet fighters scream past my building, I hear them just fine.\n\nThe call waiting rang, my mom was on the other line. She asks for my sister! Is she okay?\n \nMy sister attended a local college by the World Trade Center. Her train passed through World Trade Station. She was underground when the attack happened. She had no way of knowing what was going on above her.\n\n\"Mom?\" I asked, \"do you still want me to go out to look for work?\" As terrified as we were that day, I was still more scared of my mom.\n\n\"Not today.\"\n\nWe didn't hear from my sister. Minutes became hours. Finally, a call came from a payphone; She had evacuated the train into a tunnel. With train services disrupted, it would be take time to come home.\n\nThe last stop on the A line is never crowded. That day was different. I met my sister at the top of the stairs. Waves of people emerged from the subway. The last of the waves were covered in ash. Only their eyes showed they were alive. Ashen faces, gray matted hair and clothes: the dead appeared to rise up from the subway.\n\nAs each wave emerged, a pair of Yemeni brothers who owned the corner store selflessly offered water to those in need. They faced anger, threats, and ignorant comments in the days and weeks that followed, but what sticks with me is their act of kindness, extending water to those outstretched grey hands. \n\nThat image lingers.\n\nIn my Irish neighborhood across from Good Shepherd church the bagpipes play at funerals. In the months that followed I heard bagpipes. Every Saturday. Multiple times a day and during the week. The bagpipes played. Many of them for first responders.\n\nThat sound lingers."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"July 24, 2023","title":"Snowflake DateDiff Business Days: How do I exclude weekends?","expertise":"Analytics Engineering","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nA common ask in analytics engineering is to return the working days between two dates not the calendar days.\n","hero_alt":"Snowflake DateDiff Business Days: How do I exclude weekends between two dates in Snowflake SQL?","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/217ac44efb5208795651dee9b027be72/87706/development_sql.png","srcSet":"/static/217ac44efb5208795651dee9b027be72/f80f8/development_sql.png 320w,\n/static/217ac44efb5208795651dee9b027be72/9a63f/development_sql.png 640w,\n/static/217ac44efb5208795651dee9b027be72/87706/development_sql.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/217ac44efb5208795651dee9b027be72/c0bcc/development_sql.webp 320w,\n/static/217ac44efb5208795651dee9b027be72/17574/development_sql.webp 640w,\n/static/217ac44efb5208795651dee9b027be72/71d4d/development_sql.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"b813b982-60f6-5dfc-b4e7-9688a0891b51","fields":{"slug":"analytics_engineering/snowflake-datediff-business-days"},"parent":{"id":"f9650a5c-8b09-58a4-8f52-1f37bd52c3f1","name":"snowflake-datediff-business-days","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:44:15.132Z"},"body":"\nThis is the code leverages Snowflake DateDiff to calculate business days.\n\n`select`  \n`DATEDIFF('day', '2022-07-01', '2022-07-14') + 1`  \n`- DATEDIFF('week', '2022-07-01', DATEADD('day', 1, '2022-07-14'))`  \n`- DATEDIFF('week', '2022-07-01', '2022-07-14') as working_days`  \n`;`\n    \nIt looks a little wonky. I'll break it down into steps. Basically we are calculating three values: a, b, & c. Then we are subtracting b & c from a: a-b-c. \n\n## DateDiff Naive Count of Days\nThis first expression naively counts days between start and end.

There can never be fewer Saturdays than Sundays in a given range because Snowflake starts the week on Monday and Sunday is after Saturday. We want to check whether the last day in the range is a Saturday. This expression checks by calculating how many weeks there are in this range if the last day is forwarded by one day.\n\nFor example, if the last day is a Friday, then it moves to Saturday, and that partial week doesn't count towards our total because DATEDIFF('week', ...) only counts fully completed weeks. \n\nHowever, if the last day is a Saturday, then it gets bumped to a Sunday, and this count will increase.\n\n`- DATEDIFF('week', '2022-07-01', DATEADD('day', 1, '2022-07-14'))`\n\n## Subtract Sundays\nThis third piece counts the number of fully completed weeks, which will be the same as the number of Sundays in that range (there is one Sunday per week).        \n        \n`- DATEDIFF('week', '2022-07-01', '2022-07-14')`\n\n## Putting it all together with DateDiff to get Business Days\nPutting all the expressions together, we subtract the Saturday count and Sunday count from the first naive count to calculate the number of weekdays elapsed in the time range.\n\n`select`  \n`DATEDIFF('day', '2022-07-01', '2022-07-14') + 1`  \n`- DATEDIFF('week', '2022-07-01', DATEADD('day', 1, '2022-07-14'))`  \n`- DATEDIFF('week', '2022-07-01', '2022-07-14') as working_days`  \n`;`\n\nThis pattern can be adjusted to accommodate different week start days.\n\n## Plus 5 Business Days\n\nAs a follow up to the same idea I had to deploy logic that returned the date that is 5 business days from any given calendar date.

Back, when ETL was all I did, my team didn't even call it that. Mostly because we used Excel. I was self conscious about my lack of experience with SQL. I would say, “I move data from one place to another.” And that would get a laugh.\n\nIt was a very manual process which I ultimately automated with Python. Most of it. From that experience I gained a deep understanding of data and how it connects together. \n\nWhat’s funny is that what we call ETL today isn’t ETL either. But the name has stuck. And we all know what we mean by it. But if you don’t know, it’s hard to know.\n\nYa know?\n\n\nIf you are reading this you already know the value of timely decisions and pivoting on the data. But the task of consolidating and analyzing data from various sources is daunting. There are a lot of moving parts. The first is getting the data. In this blog post, I am going to break down ETL; how data gets from out there into your data warehouse.\n\n\n## Who this is for\n\n\n**You are a business owner or leader:**\n\nData is the new currency of business. When you invest in a data warehouse you need to fill it. ELT tools help you do that. These tools leverage automation. Use them.\n\nYou likely don’t want the detail I am about to go into. I created my [data warehousing for dummies PDF](/thoughts/data-warehousing-for-dummies-pdf) with you in mind. There are two parts, the first is the executive summary and it is written with you in mind. You can get that here. \n\n\n**You are a data analyst, data scientist, but new to data warehousing:**\n\nYou are looking for a place to get started. There are two parts to my [data warehousing for dummies PDF](/thoughts/data-warehousing-for-dummies-pdf). The second part is a deep dive into data warehousing. While it’s deep it’s still short. It’s a jumping off point.\n\nThis post is part of that deep dive.\n\n\n\n## Understanding ETL:\n\nETL, or Extract, Transform, Load, is a process that enables businesses to gather data from different sources, convert it into a unified format, and load it into a centralized database for further modeling, analysis and reporting. You will also hear it referred to as ELT. The processes are very similar only signifying a change in the order of operations because the relative cost of storage has gone down significantly over time. ELT / ETL / EL-T it’s all about getting data into the warehouse.\n\nLet's break it down step by step:\n\n**Extract**: The extraction phase involves pulling data from various channels such as Google Analytics, YouTube, social media platforms, paid traffic sources, eCommerce platforms, etc. Think of it as gathering puzzle pieces from different boxes.\n\n**Transform**: Once the data is extracted, it needs to be transformed into a standardized format. This includes cleaning the data, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency. To learn more about the transformation step, check out this comprehensive guide to the [best ETL tools](https://portable.io/learn/best-etl-tools).\n\n**Load**: After the data has been extracted and transformed, it is loaded into a central database or data warehouse where it can be accessed and analyzed. This step is crucial for creating a single source of truth for your data.\n\nIn practice, these last two steps are flipped, leading to the acronym ELT. The terms are used interchangeably. With modern tools the extract and load activities have been replaced by automated data pipelines. These pipelines abstract the minutia of the process. So often engineers will refer to ELT anytime they are talking about data ingestion.\n\n\n## Benefits of ETL tools for Business:\n\nWhen you buy a data warehouse you need to fill it. ETL tools help you do that. Good tools don’t cost, they pay. A good tool reduces the number of engineers you need to hire to manage your warehouse. Why bother? There are numerous benefits for businesses. Here are some key advantages:\n\n**Holistic view of marketing data**: Consolidate data from various sources, giving you a comprehensive view of your marketing efforts. By bringing all the pieces of the puzzle together, you gain valuable insights for informed decision-making.\n\n**Optimization of marketing strategies**: With ETL, you can analyze and understand the impact of your marketing campaigns across different channels. This empowers you to optimize your strategies, allocate resources more effectively, and drive better results.\n\n**Process automation**. A hidden benefit is automating manual tasks and processes, offering automation and increased efficiency. By centralizing data, syncing it to destinations that usually require manual intervention, and pushing it into downstream business processes, ETL pipelines provide value through process automation. Manual processes consume resources, while ETL pipelines automate the flow of information. This automation helps companies reduce operational costs, improve their bottom line, and establish a scalable foundation for innovation.\n\n**Product development**. By leveraging existing data assets, ETL enables companies to create innovative offerings and generate new revenue streams. This approach applies to various industries, including e-commerce, finance, and healthcare, empowering businesses to provide value to customers and maintain a competitive edge. Product development is a crucial process that transforms raw data into valuable products. It integrates data from multiple sources and loads it into a target system, facilitating the quick development and release of new products, services, or features.\n\nFor a deep dive into ETL tools check out this comprehensive guide to the [best ETL tools](https://portable.io/learn/best-etl-tools).\n\n\n## Addressing Concerns and Practical Tips for Data Governance:\n\nImplementing ETL may raise concerns about cost, complexity, and potential disruptions. However, with careful planning and execution, these concerns can be mitigated. Here are a few tips:\n\n**Start with a budget-friendly solution**: Many ETL tools offer flexible pricing options, allowing you to scale as your business grows.

Your business has amassed vast amounts of customer data over the years, ranging from purchase history and preferences to online interactions and feedback.The struggle is making sense of this scattered data, missed opportunities and a lack of strategic insights. At the speed of business, an effective data strategy is the key to unlocking your company's true potential.\n\nAnd if you are pressed for time, you can download my [data warehousing for dummies pdf](https://data-warehousing-for-dummies.assumewisely.com/) to read later.\n\n## The Power of Data Warehousing: Illuminating the Path to Business Success\n\nData is the lifeblood of every successful enterprise. Businesses collect data from various sources: websites, social media, customer interactions, and sales transactions. Without the right tools and strategies to organize and utilize it, the data remains a jumble of numbers and words.\n\nData warehousing is the fundamental solution to the challenges of data management. At its core, data warehousing is the process of centralizing and structuring data from disparate sources into a single, unified repository. This consolidated data is then transformed into a format that is easily accessible, usable, and most importantly, actionable.\n\nActionable.\n\n## The Connection Between Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence\n\nData warehousing and business intelligence (BI) go hand in hand, forming a powerful duo that drives strategic decision-making and provides a competitive edge in the market. By implementing a robust data warehousing system, businesses gain access to a comprehensive and reliable set of data, enabling them to derive valuable insights, patterns, and trends.

It’s all BS. Why even bother? I questioned the point of it all, ya know?\" His words pique my curiosity, and I lean in. His eye twinkles, Serge begins his story, transporting me to a world where data anomalies run rampant and the quest for truth takes an unexpected turn.\n\nSerge begins his story. This is Part II of, [I Smell Color](http://color.assumewisely.com). You can start at the begining, [Confessions of Analytics Professonals](/thoughts/confessions-analytics-professionals).\n\nWhat stays with me is the buzz in the air. The whole place is on a caffeine high, buzzing with excitement and innovation. Boy do I feel like the small fish in a big pond. The logo on the wall is unmistakable. At the time it still felt surreal to work as part of an analytics department, let alone there. Perks galore. All-you-can-eat snacks. Gourmet coffee. They've got it all covered. Nothing gets my analytical mind going like topping off a cup of joe.\n\nI sink down into the loving embrace of my ergonomic chair. Desks so long it could be the hood of a Dodge Viper. Natural light streams in through floor to ceiling windows. This is all pre-pandemic mind you, work from home wasn’t a thing.\n\nIt's not just about the creature comforts. This company knows how to inject some serious fun into the mix. Picture this—life-sized foosball. Yeah, you heard me. It's like regular foosball, but each player is an actual person attached to other actual people with a long pole, jiving and juking, trying to score a goal. It's like synchronized swimming, but with less water and more high fives. Teamwork makes the dream work, right?\n\nThen there is my boss—a real wizard when it comes to data. Slicing and dicing numbers like a chef with a sharp knife, deep understanding of the company's operations. Expertise and leadership off the charts. He is our North Star, guiding us through the vast abyss of data. And trust me, in this field, you need someone with a map and a compass, 'cause it's easy to get lost in a sea of ones and zeros. \n\nTo be honest I feel pretty dumb, but as the saying goes if you’re the smartest person in the room you're in the wrong room. I must be in the right room ‘cause I’m learning a lot. I’m a kid in a candy store, except for nerds: a sage in the stacks; a brain in the books.\n\nAnd then in an instant everything changes.\n\nOne minute, I'm part of a talented analytics team at a  marquee tech company, and the next, I'm thrust into the spotlight as my boss and several other leaders abandon ship, irreconcilable differences with management. Talk about being caught in the whirlwind. Suddenly, I find myself wearing the expert hat, not because I earned it, but because everyone who knows better is gone. It's like I'm the captain of a ship with no crew and a map full of uncharted waters.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the state of our data. At the time, we didn’t know. That was the issue. It was a black box. Our data model was opaque with logic scattered all across the data stack. As we pick around the edges a picture starts to form. Imagine a dense, thorny briar patch, each thicket representing a tangled mess of information. That's how I see it—unruly, interlacing, and chaotic. Management has a different take. They call it \"spaghetti,\" a swirling plate of tangled noodles. It’s actually not far from the truth. Each report fed directly from the source, the logic for each was self contained and sometimes borrowed.\n\nYou want an example of this spaghetti madness? Here's a good one. We have seventeen different conversion metrics. Each of them has their own specific meaning and purpose, valid in their own little worlds. But when you try to make sense of it across the business, you get seventeen flavors of conversion. Imagine Baskin Robins with 31 flavors all named, Vanilla. What's the point? We are looking for clarity, and finding a confusing conundrum of identical-sounding KPIs.\n\nBut wait, it gets better. Throughout our dataset, we stumble upon conflicting definitions for dimensions. It's like having a dictionary that contradicts itself. The same word with two definitions and you're left scratching your head, one definition says \"up,\" the other says \"down.\" Trying to make sense of such discordant definitions is solving a puzzle with mismatched pieces. We found ourselves in a precarious situation.\n\nI’m looking at this spaghetti mess, the road ahead won't be easy. We need to find a way to bring order to the chaos, to streamline our metrics, and align our definitions. But how?\n\nSo, here I am, the accidental expert, ready to untangle the spaghetti. Because if there's one thing I've learned, it's that sometimes, even the most twisted paths can lead to surprising discoveries. And who knows, maybe along the way, we'll find a hidden meatball or two. \n\nThat singular thought keeps me going. Find the meatball. There is gold in these hills, start digging.\n\nThis is Part II of my new book, [I smell color.](http://color.assumewisely.com). If you made it to this point, consider subscribing. You can sign up [here](http://color.assumewisely.com).\n\n[![I smell color.](./media/ads/i_smell_color_ad_01.png)](http://color.assumewisely.com)\n\n## How did we get here?\n\nAlright, buckle up ‘cause now we are getting into the thick of it. Have you heard of CRISP-DM, the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining? It's like a roadmap to navigating data analysis. Someone had the bright idea to come up with an acronym for wildly intuitive common sense. \n\n- Start with understanding the business.\n- Figure out what questions you want to answer.\n- Dive into the data. \n- Unleash your analytical skills, exploring the data like a curious detective. \n- Once you've uncovered some insights, fine-tune your models. \n- Finally, you present your findings. \n\nNow, grab a plate.\n\nImagine your little world of analytics as a massive bowl of spaghetti, with each noodle representing a report. Each noodle is cooked up using its unique recipe, applying CRISP-DM. It's directly modeled from the source data, seasoned based on specific questions and business objectives. You take another noodle, different report, cooked using the same CRISP-DM process but different questions means different seasoning. Each noodle, each report, has its own spin on the process, like adding various toppings or spices. Some noodles might be al dente, perfectly capturing the essence of the data, while others may be a bit overcooked, losing some of that data goodness. Mind you, that’s on purpose! Behold the spaghetti bowl of analytics! Hundreds of unique reports, each offering a different perspective, all tangled together by the common thread of the CRISP-DM approach. So, grab your fork and start twirling, because in this delicious world of data, every noodle tells its own story.\n\nThat’s a pretty good illustration of how we got to this point. For onesie-twosie analysis CRISP-DM works. But it doesn’t scale.\n\nThe more seasoned (no pun intended) analysts want to do away with data modeling all together. They want to join everything to everything. They envision it would look like a kind of mosaic. Each tile is a data source, and when assembled forms a breathtaking masterpiece . . . \n\nin theory.\n\nIn reality it’s more like a patchwork quilt with bald spots and gaps. This monolithic wide sparse table of data is large. It’s slow. And it joins everything to everything creating dependencies and points of failure across reports that for all practical purposes aren’t related.\n\nSo where CRISP-DM is too much, this mosaic model is not enough. The problem with CRISP-DM and the monolith mosaic is that each approaches data as random bits and pieces. But we don’t want to model the data, we want to model the lifeblood of business—transactions, customers, products, and everything in between. We have our source data in one hand and the reports we want to create in the other. But what we don’t have is a winning strategy to get from one hand to the other. \n\n## The Solution\n\nThe Goldilocks model is business dimensional modeling. Business dimensional modeling takes these vital concepts and arranges them in a way that reflects the reality of the business and facilitates analysis and decision-making. \n\nIn the beginning we didn’t know what to call it. So we called our efforts lego blocks. You can think of  business dimensional modeling as creating the building blocks of reporting. It's about organizing the diverse elements of a business into pieces that can be interlocked and unlocked in novel and unique ways while still maintaining a consistent foundational definition. For example, a kid can use a cardboard box as a boat, a table, or even a fort but we can still agree it’s a cardboard box. In the same way an idea can connect to another idea or concept along common dimensions and metrics, forming a cohesive and comprehensive view of the business. It represents how we think about the business because it models what we think about the business and ties in the relevant data.\n\n(At this point Serge grabs a napkin, scribbling on it before handing it to me.)\n\n![the napkin model](./media/content/business_dimensional_modeling_napkin.png)\n\nBazinga!\n\nIn contrast the CRISP-DM and mosaic models are largely dependent on their sources to define the structure. With all the different sources you lose cohesion. That is how it all gets bogged down.\n\nNailing down the problem was the first step. Wrapping our heads around business dimensional modeling was the next step. This is when we began taking our first steps away from working as analysts and started seeing ourselves as analytics engineers. At that point we still hadn’t heard the term analytics engineer, even though that is what we were doing. It wasn’t until we adopted DBT into our data stack that everything really became clear.\n\nDBT, or Data Build Tool, is our magic wand for transforming and modeling data. It's a platform that allows us to wrangle, shape, and organize the data to model the business. With the help of DBT, we can implement the principle of separation of concerns to organize and manage our transformations.\n\nSeparation of concerns is a principle in software development that advocates for breaking down a system into distinct and independent parts, with each part responsible for a specific aspect of functionality. Separation of concerns means we break down the transformation process into smaller, manageable chunks. Each transformation focuses on a specific aspect or concern, allowing us to maintain clarity and avoid tangled spaghetti code. By modularizing our transformations, we enhance reusability, maintainability, and collaboration within our team. The goal is to ensure that each component focuses on a single concern and is decoupled from other parts of the system.\n\nOne of the key tools DBT offers is Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), maps that illustrate the path our data takes from source to the final destination. These maps illustrate the data transformation arc. We start with the source data, which is often messy and unrefined. We use DBT to perform a series of transformations, taking the data on a journey from a multiverse of chaos to a world of understanding. We clean the data, apply business rules, and ensure the data conforms to our business dimensional models. These models or core business logic serve as the foundation for reporting. \n\nAs we progress along the transformation arc, our data starts to take shape. We can build data marts for specific business areas or functions. These data marts are built with our business dimensional models, ensuring that the data is structured in a way that supports efficient analysis and reporting. \n\nNow, here's the exciting part—reporting on top of our business dimensional models. With the data now organized and modeled in a meaningful way, we can unlock valuable insights and empower decision-makers with actionable information . . . at scale. We can slice and dice the data, apply filters, and drill down into specific dimensions to understand trends, patterns, and outliers. The reports we develop are consistent because they come from a single source of truth, the business dimensional model.\n\nBut wait, there's more! DBT doesn't stop at just transforming and modeling data. It also provides features for data testing, documentation, and version control. We can validate the accuracy and integrity of our transformed data, document the entire process, and ensure that changes are tracked and auditable. \n\nAnd then there is Jinja. I got started with DBT for the documentation, but I stayed for the Jinja. My interest in DBT began with a desire for automated documentation. Jinja sold it. I discovered Jinja, and my SQL game is forever changed. I really like using Jinja in my SQL. \n\nAt it's core, DBT aligns three technologies to deliver knowledge better: SQL, YAML, & Jinja. You can do a lot with just SQL and YAML. Adding in Jinja makes SQL feel a lot more like traditional development. I kinda missed that. It's like seeing an old friend that you really liked but haven't seen for a while.\n\nIt’s next level.\n\n## A Better place\n\nAnd that my friend, brings us to today. We have come a long way. We are in a better place—a place where the mystic single source of truth is no longer an elusive dream but a tangible reality within our data stack. A crystal-clear path to coherence.\n\nNot really. But you-know we’re getting there. Much closer for sure. \n\nThe backbone that stands it all up is our collection of business dimensional models. They lay the foundation for all the insights we unravel. They are the sources of truth and, and, AND we can trace 'em back to wherever the hell they came from. We turned a tangled mess of spaghetti into a neat, organized stack of . . . i don’t know . . . it’s a lasagna. We've brought order to the chaos, my friend. That’s the real freakin’ deal.\n\nEach report we build is on a solid source of truth. What's beautiful about it? Each one has the freedom to frame those truths in its own way. No cookie-cutter nonsense here. We bring a fresh perspective to each report, the freakin' art of data storytelling, my friend.\n\n<br></br>\n<br></br>\n\n“Damn,” is all I can say.\n\n## Later That Night\n\nLater that night I’m at home, my macbook open to a blank screen. I jot down the key takeaways from my conversation with Serge. I’m still laughing about “data lasagna”. Serge is a character. I reflect on the importance of good friends, people who know what you are going through and a healthy dose of humor with your troubles. Armed with newfound insights (and caffeine) I jot down some notes:\n\nAs an analyst I win when I can:\n - provide reliable metrics and KPIs\n - answer my bosses (stupid) questions\n - demonstrate competence and confidence in the data\n\nThe success of my work relies on the underlying data model. When it comes to modeling I have three options:\n - CRISP-DM (spaghetti)\n - Wide Table (threadbare patchwork quilt)\n - Business Dimensional Modeling (the only scalable alternative - lasagna)\n\nBusiness Dimensional Modeling helps me win as an analyst because:\n - core business objects create order for how we think about the stuff of our business\n - data lineage shows the transformational arc of the data\n - separation of concerns helps everyone see the steps in the transformation\n\nAs an analyst I don’t want to be beholden to my data sources to organize my thinking for me. I don’t want to reinvent the wheel from source data every time I need to create a new report. I want subject matter expertise and domain knowledge to frame the structure of how I think. I insert the data into that framework to inform decisions, tactics, opportunities, etc. If and when sh*t hits the fan, I can look to the DAGs to troubleshoot.\n\nI think I’m picking up what Serge was putting down. I'm excited to share what I've learned at work. Tomorrow. Today's been a full day.\n\n\n## Seriously, if you made it to this point, \n\nDo me a solid and subscribe.

I’m tasked with delivering reliable key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics to the boss, Stacie Dime, a decisive leader who relies on me both for crucial business decisions as well as  inane questions. The work ahead, behind, and all around is strewn with challenges and conflicting values. \n\nDay in and day out, I scour reports hoping to find the needle of truth in the haystack of numbers. The more I search, the more I feel trapped in a data-driven version of \"Where's Waldo?\" The sheer volume of information is overwhelming. I chase from minut detail to minut detail. I never seem to find the truth. I hate the feeling that I'm wrong. That feeling, I tell the group, is where my story begins.\n\n[![I smell color.](./media/ads/i_smell_color_ad_01.png)](http://color.assumewisely.com)\n\n## Stacie Dime\n\n“We’re f*cked!”\n\nThe words reverberate in my mind. Stacie Dime repeats them again and again. How many times can she utter that phrase before deciding to fire me? I am about to find out. It’s even worse when your boss . . . is also the owner. Owners are always worse. It’s more personal for them. \n\nI poured my heart and soul into . . . hours of effort condensed into a single document. Stacie dismisses it with a fleeting glance. The numbers, apparently, are all wrong.\n\nThe weight of those two words hung heavy in the air. If our reporting lacks reliability, the business suffers. The message hit hard. I glanced around the room, Harper seems very focused on not making eye contact. Everyone else looks away.\n\nIf we can’t have reliable reporting, we’re f*cked. Message received.\n\nI recount the countless hours spent poring over reports, meticulously coding my SQL, and striving for perfect formatting. I believed I had cracked the code. That of course was before Stacie saw it.\n\nI finish my story. I look across the room to see empathetic nods and knowing smiles. I'm not alone. \n\nI exhale. \n\nI feel a little better.\n\n## Serge Sookram\n\nA tantalizing scent wafts through the air, calling for an end to the meeting. It's food time. The food is usually pretty good and today—it’s from a New York deli food truck. I can't resist a juicy pastrami sandwich. It’s piled high with dill pickles and a bag of salt-n-vinegar chips. As I take a big bite, a voice from beside me exclaims, \"Nice choice! I'm Serge, an analytics engineer with an appetite for everything that'll kill me: fast food, fast cars, & fast women.” \n\nWe laugh.\n\n“I feel your pain,” Serge empathizes. “Truth be told, I'm sure my analyst said as much. I know I said it plenty, in part that drove me into analytics engineering. I subscribe to the Papa Johns school of cooking: better ingredients, better pizza. Same goes for working with data. Garbage in. Garbage out. Better data means better insights.”\n\n“Said?” I question. “Your analyst said as much. You mean as in now they don’t?”\n\n“I’d like to think so.” Serge leans back, a mischievous grin playing on his face, and says, \"You know, Max, there was a time when I encountered a metric so absurd, I had an existential crisis. It’s all BS. Why even bother? I questioned the point of it all, ya know?\" His words pique my curiosity, and I lean in. His eye twinkles, Serge begins his story, transporting me to a world where data anomalies run rampant and the quest for truth takes an unexpected turn.\n\nSerge begins his story.\n\n### Serge’s story\n\nIf you made it to this point, consider subscribing.

How do you value a master's degree... or any degree for that matter! \n\nAre you you asking these same questions? If so, I believe my experience might be useful to you. I just earned my masters's at Western Governor's University.\n\nOver the last several years I've learned managers won't necessarily hire you because you have a master's degree, but they might skip you if you don't. It may not bear on the quality of your work, but it does seem to make getting work easier.\n\n## My Decision to Go Back To School\n\nIt's after eleven on a Friday night. The food at Twin Donut  is cheap and greasy. We're waiting for our food because it's also the only place still open. Sitting at a table, I recount a scene from Good Will Hunting where Matt Damon, as Will, outwits and outsmarts an unoriginal snob in a bar closing with the classic flourish,\n\n> You wasted $150,000 on an education you could have got for a buck fifty in late charges at the public library.\n\nThe pair of beautiful blue eyes across from me are unimpressed. All they see is a college dropout with no future.\n\nThe next day, I enroll for the following semester.\n\nFour years later I graduate with a BS in Economics from Brigham Young University.\n\n## But Do I Need A Masters?\n\nEarly on in my career, I'm having a frank talk with the director of my department. He thinks I don't need a master's degree: he doesn't have one. He believes in the value of learning, but the piece of paper doesn't matter. I believe him.\n\nOver time I bring up this topic with several data scientists. I attend a confernece where it is addressed in a panel discussion. The general agreement is that you don't need a master's degree to be a data scientist. The strange thing? They all have master's degrees. Some of them - PhDs.\n\nTime passes, my career goes nowhere. I'm interviewing. I get in front of decision-makers but it seems there is always someone else with more experience they end up choosing. Everyone around me is promoted or hired into new positions. Over time I notice that this same director is fond of hiring  . . . master's degree holders. \n\nI'm fed up not seeing progress. I decided a master's degree might help.\n\n## What is A Master's Degree Worth?\n\nThe high cost of tuition is often the first thing people think about when considering going back to school. It's no secret that the cost of higher education has been on the rise for years. According to The College Board, for the 2021-22 school year, private college tuition and fees averaged $38,070 while state residents attending public colleges paid an average of $10,740 per year. Out-of-state residents at public universities shelled out an average of $27,560 annually. Cost is the obvious challenge everyone likes to bring up. But focusing on cost alone is a mistake.\n\nI know many people with graduate degrees who work entry-level jobs. A graduate degree is no guarantee of a high-paying job. The value of a degree is not in the price tag. Price and value are  very different concepts. Price is what you pay, while value is the benefit you get. The value of a degree is in what it can do for you and - and - what you do with it?\n\n## What A Master's Degree Will Do For You\n\nGraduate degrees typically act as a filter for hiring managers when they are trying to decide who to interview. HR managers are busy, with everyone in the program having been pre-screened, there's less of a chance the manager will waste time. The filtering aspect of graduate programs is very real, and difficult to overcome on your own.\n\nA degree can open doors not previously accessible. Once my resume displayed my newly minted  degree, I encountered less opposition throughout interviews. I started getting offers. It didn't seem to matter that it was post-dated to 2022.\n\n## What a Master's Degree Will Not Do\n\nIn \"The End of Business Schools? Less Success Than Meets the Eye,\" a study published in *Academy of Management Learning and Education* Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University and Christina Fong of the University of Washington analyze forty years of data in an effort to find evidence that business schools make their graduates more successful. The result?\n\nBusiness schools do  . . . almost nothing. Business schools are ineffective, as neither an MBA degree nor grades obtained in coursework correlate to professional success. Getting an MBA has zero correlation with long-term career success. None.\n\nBy now I start to see a master's degree will get me to the interview. And help me look less risky as a new hire. After that it is all on me.\n\n## How To Value A Degree\n\nMy student debt is shown as a liability on my financial statements. That doesn't give the whole story. It simply shows how I paid for school. On the other side of my financial statement, I have an asset called human capital. Now, what is the value of my human capital asset?\n\nOn my financials, I record the value as what I paid. This offsets my loan so it's a wash and keeps things simple. It really doesn't matter.\n\nWhat does matter? The proportion of my student loan payment to the increase in earnings. According to a Payscale study, the typical wage for someone with a bachelor's degree is $60,000 per year. However, the average income for individuals without a bachelor's degree is only $47,000. Is it worth going back for a batchelor's?\n\nThe batchelor's degree holder makes around $1,000 extra each month. With a student loan payment of about $300, that leaves $700 more to spend every month. That investment makes sense.\n\nYou can expect to make over $100,000 as a data scientist. Perhaps not right away, but certainly over time. That is twice as much as the original non-degree employee. Even if your student loan payment is double - triple - that investment makes sense.\n\n## Brush Your Teeth\n\nHow to make sense of it all? There is evidence that an MBA has no real influence. Many people in the business agree. In fact, before I finished my degree, I started a new job - twice. So... Do you truly need one?\n\nI think so.\n\nThe filtering aspect of graduate programs is very real, and difficult to overcome on your own. Look at a degree as a hygiene factor like brushing your teeth. Good hygiene doesn't win you a date, but bad hygiene will loose you a date. Similarly, managers won't necessarily hire you because you have a master's degree, but they might skip you if you don't. It may not bear on the quality of your work, but it does seem to make getting work easier.\n\nIt's a mistake to believe a degree will do all the heavy lifting. My career growth (ahem, income) is largely due to the field I pursued, business intelligence reporting as a BI developer. My earnings return is largely influenced by my line of work. It's crucial to consider the area in which you want to work.\n\nThe degree checks a box and clears the way for you to advance. I just needed a little leverage to get in a specific door, I believe my degree helped me do that. \n\n## Why WGU\n\nIf you're having trouble finding employment or advancing in your career, a graduate degree may give you an edge in your career journey. You don't need to overspend. A degree is a degree. You need it, doesn't matter from where. The less you spend, the better your ROI.\n\nWGU was a great fit for me. I am a non-traditional student. I grew up in a culture that did not value education. I'm a parent. I work full time. I cannot quit either of those responsibilities. I needed to squeeze graduate school around those responsibilities. Working at my own pace allowed me to better manage everything else going on in my life. WGU not only understood my needs, they met them - and the price was very reasonable.\n\n## Are you walking?\n\nWhen I graduated from Brigham Young, I skipped the graduation ceremony. I didn't \"walk\". I just wanted that piece of paper. That didn't change when enrolling at WGU - I just wanted that piece of paper to list on my resume. Along the way that changed.\n\nIn August, I walked for two reasons: so both of them could see their dad earn a master's degree. My first experience at a graduate degree ceremony was my own.  I wanted their experience to be different. Growing up, I didn't see many people who look like me earning degrees. I want their experience to be different. I grew up in a culture that did not value education. I want their experience to be different."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"September 3, 2022","title":"Counterfactual Analysis","expertise":"Artificial Intelligence","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nCounterfactual analysis can be used to determine the lift of a campaign or ad. \n","hero_alt":"Counterfactual Analysis","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#085898","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3cdde01a6ccf500dc507919158c9d965/87706/data_savvy_3.png","srcSet":"/static/3cdde01a6ccf500dc507919158c9d965/f80f8/data_savvy_3.png 320w,\n/static/3cdde01a6ccf500dc507919158c9d965/9a63f/data_savvy_3.png 640w,\n/static/3cdde01a6ccf500dc507919158c9d965/87706/data_savvy_3.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3cdde01a6ccf500dc507919158c9d965/c0bcc/data_savvy_3.webp 320w,\n/static/3cdde01a6ccf500dc507919158c9d965/17574/data_savvy_3.webp 640w,\n/static/3cdde01a6ccf500dc507919158c9d965/71d4d/data_savvy_3.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"904efcbc-13c7-5eb2-be4b-038ec7179f6e","fields":{"slug":"artificial_intelligence/counterfactual-analysis"},"parent":{"id":"3f7eb9c8-c0c6-54f5-a4ba-502a27806623","name":"counterfactual-analysis","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:44:04.040Z"},"body":"How would things be different if something hadn't happened? This is what counterfactual analysis looks at. For example, we can look at how sales change as a result of a new marketing campaign and attribute the incremental lift in sales due to the campaign. By doing this, we can understand what portion of sales is a result of the campaign, and which would have happened anyway. Counterfactual analysis can be done in addition to traditional lift analysis or when traditional lift analysis is not possible.\n\nTo figure out what would have happened without the campaign, break your audience into two groups. The first group sees the ad. The second group is similar to the first group, but doesn't see the ad.\n\nThe results from this second control group allow us to see what would have happened with our test group had they not seen the ad.\n\nCounterfactual impact evaluation methods encompass double difference analysis (or difference-in-difference), randomized selection of subjects, propensity score matching and instrumental variable analysis. It is also possible to combine methods. For example, propensity score matching can be used to create treatment and control groups, while double difference analysis can be employed to evaluate the impact of the treatment.\n\n## Double Difference Analysis\nDouble difference analysis compares treatment and control groups at different time periods. The first step is to look at the difference between the groups. The second step is to look at the difference over time between the groups.\n\nDouble difference analysis takes into account that there are some invisible characteristics that account for differences between the treatment and control groups. If these characteristics do not change over time, their impact can be eliminated by comparing both groups before and after the treatment.\n\nDouble difference means that two kinds of differences are assessed. Firstly, the difference in time (before and after the intervention), and secondly, the difference between individuals who were subjected to the intervention and those who were not.\n\nLet's look at how to analyze the average number of sales per day as an example. Assume that an intervention is applied to the treatment group, they see an ad. This will cause a change in time (“before-after”). We can measure much this treatment changes things by subtracting the change in average number of sales per day for the control group from the change in average number of sales per day for the treatment group. This will give us a double difference estimator (treatment’s impact estimate).\n\nDouble difference analysis is based on the idea that, if there was no treatment, the average number of sales per day in the treatment group would be the same as the average number of sales per day in the control group. The counterfactual situation is what would have happened if there was no treatment.\n\n## Double Difference Regression\nDouble difference regression helps to see if the impact is statistically significant. It also helps to take into account the influence of additional periodic or structural factors.\n\nWe can develop this regression model:\n\nYi,t = a + b1*Ti + b2*Pt + b3*Ti*Pt + ԑi,t\n\nwhere:\n\n**Yi** is the outcome of a sale in a particular period. This can be measured by the number of sales.\n\n**Ti** is a variable that has two possible values: 1, if a product participated in the treatment, and 0, if a product did not participate in the treatment.\n\n**Pt** is a variable that can have two different values. The first value, 0, reflects the time period before the intervention happened. The second value, 1, reflects the time period after the intervention happened.\n\n**Ti*Pt** is the outcome of the two previous variables which acquires value 1 only when the outcome of the product that received the treatment, in the period after the treatment, is taken into account.\n\n**ԑi,t** is an error of the regression.\n\n**a, b1, b2, b3** are parameters of the regression that are under evaluation.\n\n**a** reflects the average outcome (sale) of the product which did not participate in the treatment, in the period before receiving the treatment;\n\n**b1** reflects the initial difference between the treatment and control groups;\n\n**b2** reflects the difference in the outcomes (e.g. sales) of the products that did not participate in the treatment between periods;\n\n**b3** reflects an impact estimate.\n\nThe significance of the parameters is evaluated at the same time. For example, if the parameter that reflects the impact estimate is not statistically significant, then it is important to be careful about saying that the assistance definitely had an impact.\n\n**TLDR:** Counterfactual analysis can be used to determine the lift of a campaign or ad. Counterfactual analysis is a method used to determine the difference in outcomes between groups that saw an ad and groups that did not. This analysis takes into account that there are some invisible characteristics that account for differences between groups. If these characteristics do not change over time, their impact can be eliminated by comparing both groups before and after the test group sees the ad."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"August 26, 2022","title":"Values Based Leadership for the Modern Age","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nLeaders provide stability in an unstable environment, inspire teams to achieve great things.

Saturday afternoon, I’m unloading groceries. I don't remember what set me off, I just remember chucking the giant Costco package of toilet paper across my lawn in the general direction of my front door. I'd had it.\n\nI was tired. Tired of being broke. Tired of all the crap in my life. Too much nagging. Not enough sex. Too much weight. Not enough exercise. Too much work. Not enough results. Too much month at the end of the money. And my kids...my only reason to endure, were killing me.\n\nI dreaded the weekend. Another reminder of how much my life sucked. At least when I went to work, I could focus on work and take my mind off things. Monday mornings were the worst: the inevitable question, what did I do over the weekend? The truth is, I spent my weekends simmering, waiting for Monday because we were broke. I couldn't afford to do anything.\n\nMy wife's had it too. \"It's never enough,\" she says, \"You're never happy.\" My wife is tired. Tired of seeing me like this. She is right of course. I keep repeating the same line: the idea that when I graduate college, get my first job, get a new job, make a certain amount of money . . . then I'll be happy. But that isn't true at all! I keep moving the goal posts because each step doesn't make me happier, it just frustrates me more that I am not where I want to be.\n\n## What are some benefits of having strong company values in place?\nWhen you come across a community that can clearly identify its values,  it has an attractive force. Values are inherently fuzzy. We're all seeking them in some form. When a community finds them it's natural want to participate in something that is larger than yourself. It pulls you in.\n\nWhen I wasn't simmering on the weekends, I worked at Entrata. Entrata is exceptional in living it’s values. Entrata is a fun place to work, it’s a value: business in the front, party in the back. We worked hard, we played hard.  It was easy to adopt Entrata’s values as my own. It was easy to resonate with them. \n\nWhen values are clear it creates trust. It creates a common ground you can build on. It builds the foundation of a relationship. \n\nIt also modeled for me how to live intentionally and not by default. I needed to see that. It gave me permission to do likewise. It prodded me to look at my own values. To turn the default setting off.\n\n## What are some common pitfalls to avoid when developing company values?\nThat default setting is what I call shouldy values: focusing on what should be, what I should have had by now. At the time I suffered from shouldy values. One in particular: Big house. Nice car. I didn't even want that big a house, just bigger. I didn't even want that nice a car, just nicer. In the absence of actual values those shouldy values end up as a fairly common default:\n<br/>\n\n> What's it all for? Tour bus, studio, and the fans, \n\n> What's it all for? Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims,\n\n> What's it all for? To feed my family and my friends,\n\n> What's it all for? To change your world the best I can.\n\n> [What's It All For](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEk_XPY1sSg), Bazaar Royal\n<br/>\n\nAcknowleging these default shouldy values is an important first step. Acknowledging the bad values isn't the same as discovering the valuable ones. Now, how is discovery achieved? I can only speak to my own journey. It was [a long process](/thoughts/values-2015) of figuring things out as I went along. It's not learning something new; It's simply remembering what you already know.\n\nDiscovering values is an art. It's creative expression. It isn't additive, like molding clay. It's subtractive, like carving into stone. You're looking to unearth something under the surface. It's always been there. Don't try to create new values; all you can truely do is expose the real ones.\n\n### The Mistake That Is Costing You\nTake a look at what you wrote in your last performance evaluation. Do you concentrate on your actions? Take a look at your resume. Where is the emphasis? Is it on your accomplishments? Consider the last excellent movie you saw or book you read. What can you tell me about it?\n\nDon't give away the plot! Focusing on the 'what' is a temptation everyone falls prey to.\n\nStart with \"Why.\" Simon Sinek wrote a book on it, but you can get away with just watching his TED talk.\n\n[![Start With Why](./media/content/start_with_why_video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4)\n\nAnyone (and everyone) can tell you what they do.\n\nSome can talk about how. This is 90% of what marketers will focus on: differentiating value proposition, proprietary process, secret sauce, or USP.\n\nVery few discuss the importance of Why, Purpose, Cause, Belief. However, these are crucial to consider. Why do you wake up every day? More importantly, why should anyone care? People don't buy what you do--they buy why you do it. Your product simply serves as proof of what you believe.\n\nThe goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. It is not making money; that is a result. \n\nStart with Why, then follow it up with How and What.\n\n## How can you go about developing your own company values?\nEntrata continuously invests in its values, it's not a one-time thing. It starts with interviews--my friend preped me that they would ask about the company's values. They did. Every week, we encouraged each other to live up to these values. \"Talk to me Goose\", TTMG, was common shorthand for communication as was \"Be Excellent\" to .... our customers ... each other, etc. Values were on display at Values week as well as other company events. Each year during our annual review, we addressed how well we lived up to the Entrata values.\n\nI said before Entrata is a fun place to work: business in the front, party in the back. The symbol of that particular value is the mullet.  At Entrata the conference rooms are named after famous mullets: there is Aggassi, Norris, Bolton, and Cyrus just to name a few. Walk into Norris and the large display monitor has a screensaver featuring . . . Chuck Norris. That's cool. That's fun. \n\nComing to Purple Innovation I see a similar theme to our conference rooms. Instead of famous mullets, Purple's conference rooms are named after scientists: Da Vinci, Tesla, Edison. It's not listed as one of our values, but \"Thanks Science!\" is a popular phrase Purple uses for swag and social media. Science isn't expressly stated in our current values; it underlies several of them. As a data analyst, that is attractive. I believe in science, I invest in knowledge.\n\n## How to Start with Why\nI bought [Start With Why](https://amzn.to/3Tmc3HF) hoping to learn how. The book comes up short on teaching how. The book focuses on why it matters and at the end Simon upsells his $100 course to help you find your why. I opted to figure it out on my own-- read still broke. It took a little over a year to nail down a repeatable process. But it was free! If you are interested in learning how I did it, keep reading.\n\nIt can be tough to figure out your Why. It's innately fuzzy and [hard to pin down](/thoughts/values-2015). Your goal is to bring it into sharp focus. That might take some time. Keep revisiting the idea, and you'll get there.\n\nMy initial efforts were strongly influenced by the [Strengths Finder 2.0 Assessment](https://amzn.to/3KqROVx). I strongly recommend this assessment; it's free when you buy [Strengths Finder 2.0](https://amzn.to/3KqROVx). This is a fantastic tool for determining your natural talents to set you apart from the crowd. Strenghts are your USP, your secret sauce. This task is well worth your time. Even as I studied my talents I was keenly aware that I was missing the mark. Strengths speak to your How not your Why. Strengths aren't the same as purpose. \n\nIt's ironic that the question Simon Sinek leaves unanswered in his TED talk is answered by another TED talk: How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes by Adam Leipzig.\n\n[![How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes](./media/content/life_purpose_video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M)\n\nThe term \"elevator pitch\" is something you're undoubtedly familiar with. Adam goes through a series of questions to help you articulate yours in under five minutes: your own elevator pitch that starts with why. You can check out mine on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rholall/). Or my [Instagram Bio](https://www.instagram.com/rho_lall/).\n\nThis is starting with Why. This is real progress. This is material acomplishment. This is . . . not enough. This is not going to weather the storm.\n\nThe storm comes.\n\n## The Cure For Shouldy Values\nYou are going to fill out [a bracket for your values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing). Think March Madness, but with values.\n\nThis is most easily done using Post-It notes. I've started you off with [a pretty good list of values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing). Look for ideas in this list, or simply google \"list of values.\" On a post-it notes, write down the values that appeal to you. One value per Post-It. If a term attracts your attention, note it down on a post-it. Don't edit yourself at this step.\n\nCreate categories such as relationships, things, talents, traits, and skills. You should already have a stack of post-it notes on hand. Sort your notes into these categories. Overlook this step and you may have to start over because you prioritize certain categories above others. In the last stage, it will become obvious why this is significant.\n\nFinally, fill out your bracket. Hold a tournament for each category (think March Madness). Each value will compete against another. Consider a pair of values. If you have to pick one, which do you keep? The winner advances. Repeat until there is a clear winner for each category. You can repeat the process to determine second place and so on until your values are ranked for each category.\n\nThe categories are crucial because you might prioritize one category over another. This was my experience: even though I highly value knowledge, values in other categories killed it off simply because knowledge is a thing. I value things least. I realized the need for categories when I saw knowledge dropping deep down in the ranking. Play with it, flex the bracket to meet your needs. The bracket is designed to spark your own intuition. It's not intended as an objective measure.\n\n## Knowing your company's values can help you with tough decisions\nValues are a tool of effective leadership. Values afford leaders the leverage they need so they don't have to be present in every meeting. Values create leverage for thinking and decision making. What do I mean? \n\nWhen I have a disagreement with my wife, we have a few  options:\n\n- Concede. That's my go-to. For most things it just doesn't matter.\n- Persist. Endure.  Bully. Until the other person concedes. \n- Compromise. No one gets what they want.\n- Leverage our common values.\n\nTake a step back. Remeber who we are and what we value. Elevate the discussion to a higher plane. Base our discussion from a position of common ground. Leverage our values to make the decision. Ask, \"What do people like us who hold these values do in this situation?\"\n\nNow your values become a tool. Your values are the foundational data your tribe has available to make informed decisions. They are the fundamental building block that drives everything else in the org.\n\n## Tell Me Your Story.\nWe all forget. We all need to be reminded of our purpose. Jamie Dimon once said, \n<br/>\n\n> \"Leadership is relentless storytelling.\" \n<br/>\nTell me your story. Do the work, what story is yours to tell? It's a story about you, your tribe, and what you do for them. It starts with what you believe, what you value. But it can't just be about you. Your story is about what you do to help your tribe to reach their ideal, achieve thier goals, overcome thier trials. You need to be really clear about who you are, what you believe, and how you stand out. You need to be clear so you can clearly communicate to your tribe. How else will they know? When you share your values it will resonate with them. They will be better for it.\n\nThis is your contribution, what you do to serve them."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"June 27, 2022","title":"Gotta Start Somewhere","expertise":"My Journey","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nNow the flip side is of the same question, “What would I invest my next 10 years doing?

In terms of SEO There are three big areas of focus. \nThe first is page content.  How SEO relates to the content on each individual page of your website.\nThe second section i'm going to focus on is page structure. How the page is built.\nThe third section i'm going to focus on is site structure.\nI'll focus on all three characteristics as part of this SEO triangle.\n\n![SEO Triangle](./media/content/seo_triangle.png) \n\nGoogle actually publishes a [handy search engine optimization or SEO starter guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide)\n through the google search central. We're going to go through this and go over the various pieces of how a site should be built\nand optimized. I will also touch on the technology I use to publish search engine optimized content.\n\n`I build using Gatsby a react framework. For SEO i use Helmet. The react helmet allows me to build SEO\ninto my content programatically, saving me from having to do it all manually.`\n\n## How can i structure content? The first piece the SEO triangle.\n\nYou'll notice up at the top of the browser the tab has a page title. The left side is the specific name of the page and the right side is the name of the\nsite. This is best practice SEO strategy. Helmet allows me to do this programatically. This is big.\nIf I reference Google Search Central in the SEO Guide it says, \n\n- Create unique accurate page titles.\n\nThe title tag inside the head is where you're going to find the title of the page. Google goes on to say,\n\n- Create good titles and snippets in search results.\n- The best practice is to choose a title that reads naturally and effectively that communicates the topic of the page's content.\n- avoid single title across all your pages or large groups\n\nWhat you don't want to do is list each page with the same title. With these tools I can do this at scale.\nThe result is specific title names for each page of a site. \n\n\nGoogle is also looking for some sort of description. Google recommends,\n\n- Use the description meta tag\n\nThe description tag is meta description with content. What merits a good description? \nEssentially, about 160 characters inside your page to sum up what the page is about.\n\nIn addition content should include titles, not just the page title but, the h1 title tag and relevant\nparagraph h2s and h3s. I always build my sites when possible with only one h1 tag. That is like a chapter\ntitle of a book. Chapters don't have two titles. They only have one.\nMy recommendation is always having a single h1 on a page.\n\nNow let's swich gears to page structure.\n\n## The fastest front end for the modern web\n\nWhy  care about fastest?  Because Google cares about fastest.\nGoogle has an entire page called developers.google.com/speed. \nTheir goal is to make the web faster.\nThis is a great tool to use to analyze any website to see how fast or how slow the page loads.\nThe great part about this is that most sites built on Gatsby hit really high speeds. \nOlder sites (*cough WordPress*) basically run much slower.\nThe reason for that is Gatsby's built on a fast framework.\nThe site is already pre-built for speed.\nWhat i really am a huge proponent of Gatsby is the gatsby-image handling.\n\nThe biggest load time of any website is going to be images on your page.\nVideos load differently because they're going to be loading through iframes and through Youtube, Vimeo.\nPictures take up load time.\nThe great part about Gatsby is it helps optimize that speed for your web page so the user is\nnot waiting forever to see your page.\n\nGatsby generates webp images. Not jpeg or png. Now what the heck is a webp format?\nIt's is actually a new image format for the web developed by Google.\nGoogle developed its own image format that makes pictures smaller, which of\ncourse Google wants, to build a faster web.\nSo even if my source files are jpeg and png, i can convert them to webp at scale, lowering the file size\nand making for the fastest front end on the modern web.\n\nYour site loads faster.\n\n## The last piece, site structure.\n\nSimple URLs convey content information. URLs like the\nfollowing can be confusing and unfriendly:\n\n- brandonsbaseballcards.com/folder1/224475/x2/55843.html\n\nAs you can see here Google likes structures that convey information:\n\n-  brandonsbaseballcards.com/article/ten-rarest-cards.html\n\nI can gnerate this dynamically using slugs. The slugs take into account my\nfolder structure. I don't just name something 'untitled'.

It helps business leaders make data-driven decisions, which in turn leads to better customer experiences, optimized churn rates, and accelerated growth. There are two distinct services involved in business intelligence reporting: curated content and self-service.\n\n## The Advantages of BI Reporting \n\nMaking business decisions based on data rather than intuition or guesswork can lead to a better outcome for your business. Data-driven decision-making allows you to use actual information rather than a hunch or best guess to make choices about how to move your business forward. This can be especially helpful when it comes to areas like marketing, where making the wrong choice can mean losing customers and revenue.\n\nData-driven decision-making is also important when it comes to reducing churn. If you can identify which customers are most likely to leave, you can take steps to prevent them from doing so. Additionally, using data to make decisions about product development can help you create products that are more in line with what your customers want.\n\nOverall, using data rather than intuition or guesswork to make business decisions can lead to better outcomes for your company.\n\n\n## How BI Reporting Drives Data-Driven Decision Making \n\nMost business leaders are faced with the challenge of dealing with too much data. Data is more and more ubiquitous, it's too much to sift through when making important decisions. Leaders do not have the time to sort through all of the data themselves in order to find the insights they need.\n\nBusiness intelligence reporting is the process of transforming data into insights that add value to the business. It helps business leaders make data-driven decisions, which in turn leads to better customer experiences, optimized churn rates, and accelerated growth. BI reporting encompasses two distinct services: curated content and self-service. \n\nThe first service is a curated collection of assets such as data composition requests (csv data dumps), reports, and dashboards. Most decision-makers want to consume curated content. They don't want to build it themselves. The second service is providing an experience where business leaders can self-serve and dive into the data to answer questions at the speed of business. These two needs are at odds. There is data that needs to be right. There is data that needs to be right . . . now.\n\nIn order to do this, business intelligence reporting requires governance and processes to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and scalable. This means ensuring a single source of truth that is consistent across different departments and platforms. This can be important when you are expanding your business and need to make sure that all of your data is aligned.\n\nBusiness intelligence reporting helps business leaders focus on the business rather than on data management. By providing business leaders with curated content and self-service experiences, business intelligence reporting allows them to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently. \n\n## Trend Reports\nBusiness intelligence reporting can help business leaders identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent when looking at raw data.\n\nA trend report is a type of business intelligence report that helps business leaders identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent when looking at raw data. Trend reports can help business leaders make decisions about where to allocate resources in order to capitalize on current trends and avoid potential pitfalls.\n\nWhen creating a trend report, it is important to consider the time frame that the report covers. Is the trend increasing or decreasing? What is the direction of the trend? Is it linear or exponential? What is the cause and effect relationship between different factors?\n\nIt is also important to use graphs and visuals to help business leaders understand the data. Trends are often difficult to spot when looking at raw data, but can be easily identified when presented in a graphical format.\n\nTrend reports can be helpful for business leaders in all industries, but they are especially useful for businesses in fast-paced industries like technology and retail. By staying ahead of the curve, business leaders in these industries can ensure that they are not left behind.\n\n## Comparative Analysis (Comps)\nComparative analysis reports are business intelligence reports that compare two or more data sets. They can be used to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.\n\nThere are several different types of comparative analysis reports. The most common type is a side-by-side comparison report. This report compares two sets of data head-to-head. It can be used to identify which data set is larger, which data set is more recent, or which data set is more accurate. A common comparison is to compare a previous period in time, last year, last quarter, or last week.\n\nA waterfall report is another type of comparative analysis report. This report compares multiple data sets and identifies how each data set relates to the others. It can be used to track changes in data over time or to identify relationships between different factors.\n\nComparative analysis reports can be helpful for business leaders in all industries, but they are especially useful for businesses that operate in multiple geographies. By comparing data from different markets, businesses can identify trends and patterns that may not be apparent when looking at data from a single market.\n\n\n##How to Create a BI Report \nWhen it comes to business intelligence reporting, one of the most important aspects is the quality of the data. In order to ensure that data is accurate and relevant, business intelligence reporting requires a certain level of governance and processes.\n\nWhen it comes to business intelligence reporting, one of the most important aspects is the quality of the data. In order to ensure that data is accurate and relevant.\n\nOne way to achieve this is by using a layered approach to development. This approach divides  data processing into multiple layers, each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the development process.\n\nIn software development, the data layer is responsible for developing and managing the data that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes collecting data from various sources, cleansing and transforming the data, and loading the data into a database.\n\nThe business layer is responsible for developing the logic that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes developing algorithms and formulas, creating queries, and building reports and dashboards.\n\nThe presentation layer is responsible for developing the user interface that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes designing screens, setting up navigation, and creating buttons and controls.\n\nBy using a layered approach, business intelligence reporting can be effectively managed and maintained. The layers work together to ensure that data is accurate and relevant, and that business leaders have the information they need to make informed decisions.\n\n\n## Tips for Using BI Reporting Effectively\n\nBusiness intelligence reporting can be a powerful tool for business leaders, but it is not effective unless it is used correctly. Here are a few tips for using business intelligence reporting effectively:\n\n- Make sure the data is accurate and relevant.\n- Use a layered approach to development.\n- Follow best practices for data governance.\n- Use business intelligence reports to make informed decisions.\n\nWith business intelligence reporting in place, companies can trust the data they are working with to make informed decisions."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"May 22, 2022","title":"Tailwind CSS","expertise":"Analytics Engineering","author":"Rho Lall","short":" Notes on using Tailwind CSS that I find useful and want to keep handy.

In the purest (type designer) sense, an oblique is a roman font that has been skewed a certain number of degrees (8-12 degrees, usually). An italic is created by the type designer with specific characters (notably lowercase a) drawn differently to create a more calligraphic, as well as slanted version.\n\nIt's best to specify an italic only when you're sure that font has been designed with one, so make sure to import the italic version of the font.

Not a pleasant sight.\n\n**Line-Height** or 'leading' is the white space between lines of text. For reading text on desktop devices, the ideal line height of around 1.5 to 1.6. It always depends on your typeface, and the shorter the line, the lower the line height can be, especially for headings.\n\n**Letter-Spacing** or 'tracking' is the white space between letters. \n\n**Text-Align** values include: center, left, right, & justify. When using justify make sure to set a max width. The ideal line has a length of 60 to 80 characters.\n\n**Text-Transform** with a value 'capitalize' will Proper Case the text.\n\n## MDX\n[MDX](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/glossary/mdx/)\n: MDX makes it possible to include React components in your Gatsby blog posts and pages.\n[MDXProvider](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/customizing-components/)\n\n[Gatsby JS Course: Add Styles to Markdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOYshXpGdv4)\n\n[Customizing Markdown Components](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/routing/customizing-components/)\n\n\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"May 9, 2022","title":"Understanding Git","expertise":"Analytics Engineering","author":"Rho Lall","short":"A little Git goes a long way.

You can get pretty deep into a development career with just the basics. This video on [Git Core Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR6G2v_WsRA) is a good starting place.\nI developed a workflow based on ten lines of Git code. I learned how to deal with merge conflicts but, if you organize your work well they don't come up.\n<br/>\n\n**To start:**\n\n    - git status (make sure there isn't any uncommited code)\n    - git checkout *your-development-branch-name*\n    - git pull (make sure you are working off of the most up to date code)\n    - clear (not needed but i like to keep my terminal clean)\n    - git checkout -b *new-branch-name, ususally a task name*\n<br/>\n\nYou are clear to code. When you are ready to make a commit,\n\n    - git status (I always want to check)\n    - git add .\n    - git commit -m \"*Your commit description.*\"\n<br/>\n\nCommit often. I do lots of small commits and comment my process.\n<br/>\n\n**Then when I am done with the task:**\n\n    - git push\n    - git push --set-upstream origin (only needed on the first push for a new branch)\n<br/>\n\n That's it. A crib sheet with those ten lines of code saw me through my entire development career up until . . . a couple of days ago. These are the basics. \n <br/>\n\n From here forward is what i consider intermidiate Git. A couple of days ago i added four lines to my crib sheet:\n <br/>\n\n **F'ing Up with Git**\n    - git log --oneline\n    - q (to exit)\n    - git reset --hard _sha1-hash-listed-in-the-git-log_\n<br/>\n\nThe sha1 hash identifies what step you want to go back to and resets the commit history as well as your local files.\nThis overwrites any local changes you havn't commited\nIt resets (clears out) the staging area and overwrites content in the working directory (local) to what it looked like at the point of the commit identified\nLastly, when you just want your remote to match what you have locally:\n    - git push -f origin main\n<br/>\n\n**Questions**\n**What is a git working tree? What is a commit graph?**\nThere are three logical areas in which we work with our files: the working tree, staging area, and git history. The working tree is our file system. When we add, delete, and edit files, we do that in the working tree. The git history is the commit graph or commit history. To commit a change made in the working tree, that change needs to be staged (moved to the staging area).\nWe can unstage a file using,  git reset head fileName\nWe can then restore the working tree file using, git checkout –fileName\n<br/>\n\n**What is the best practice for managing branches?**\nBranches allow us to work on different versions of the sames files in parallel. Edits on one branch are independent of the other branches. We can have a production branch, a development branch, and a branch to address bug fixes.\nThe way git knows what branch we are on is a special pointer called head. HEAD points to a branch, not specifically to a commit. In Git speak, HEAD tells us what we have checked out.\nTechnically, a branch is just a pointer to a sha1 hash.\n<br/>\n\n**How do i keep track of where i am in the commit path? How do i keep track of what branch i have files in (main / gh-pages / source)?**\nCheckout a branch. The working tree will be updated to reflect the files in that branch. you can lookt at the commit graph to see changes. \nYou can also use git diff to compare differences between branches. \n\n- git log —all –decorate –oneline –graph \n- alias graph=’git log —all –decorate –oneline –graph’\n- git diff\n\n<br/>\n\n- **What is the origin? And what is the master / main?**\n- **Do they exist (coexist) in both the local and remote repository?**\n- **Or is one origin and the other main, (IE Local is origin and remote is main)?**\n\n- Origin is an alias for the pointer to a remote repository (ie. git@github.com:user/repository.git). Master and main are names given to the default branch of a repository.\nOrigin/master is a remote-tracking branch.  It tells us what the master branch looks like @ origin. Fetch returns just the commit log to check if there are changes. To bring those changes in we use merge. Git pull combines these two commands into one action.\n\n    - git fetch origin\n    - git merge origin/main\n    - git pull\n<br/>\n\nAdding more context to origin-master, le can look at the command, git push origin master, which uploads files to the remote (origin) in the master branch. \n<br/>\n\n\n\n**Git Resources**\n- [How to Reset, Revert, & Return to Previous States in Git](https://opensource.com/article/18/6/git-reset-revert-rebase-commands)\n- [Git Core Concepts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR6G2v_WsRA)\n- [Git Branches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FyAAIHHClqI)  \n- [Git Remotes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gg4bLk8cGNo)\n- [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)\n- [A Visual Git Reference](https://marklodato.github.io/visual-git-guide/index-en.html)"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"May 4, 2022","title":"Building Insight","expertise":"Design","author":"Rho Lall","short":"Do you find yourself sifting through signal and noise?

Insight is the story we tell to provide understanding about our KPIs. \nMarshall McLuhan, known for his studies of the effects of mass media on thought and behaviour said, \n**“A point of view can be a dangerous luxury when substituted for insight and understanding.”**\n Historical trends and context related to drivers are not a substitute for understanding. \n Our point of view is also not a substitute for understanding. Taken together and combined with other points of view, they can lead to understanding.\n <br/>\n\n**Build in action or build inaction.** According to Carly Fiorina, the goal is to turn data into information, and information into insight. Unfortunately, that isn’t true in practice. Insight alone is worthless unless it changes behavior and enables better decision making. We must build tools that cater to the human experience.

I struggled with finding my voice. To be candid, I had a voice, just not one I could publish. I feared my voice would betray me as youthful, inexperienced, and stupid,\nbecause I was all these things. \n\nMy struggle came to a head when I read Stephen Covey's 8th Habit (of Successful People). According to Covey, expressing your voice is a key to lifelong holistic success. I took that to heart but fundamentally found the book frustrating because I didn't see myself as able to offer anything of value.  At the time I thought, maybe when I'm 40, I'll have something useful to share. Well, now I do. And while I still fear that I might reveal my inexperience and stupidity, my years of experience betray me. It's about time I stopped using these excuses. \nWhat can I say today that could help my 20-year-old self?\n\nDon’t be a little bitch. Man up. Grow a pair. Drop your sack. Do man-shit. Stop caring about what other people think of you. Start caring about what you think of you. \nWhile that remains true to who I am and has supported me, it isn’t true for who I was. I’m sure that little bitch had something useful to share. What more could I say to help him out?\n\nPay attention to the chapter endings. As you live your life, chapters develop. Chapters will begin and chapters will end. Be mindful of when the chapters end. Take a beat. Summarize the lessons learned. Write it down. This is not the same as journaling which is capturing the experiences of the day. Journaling has its value: by all means, journal. But know that the real value is in the stories that leave an impression on your soul. What memories form the cornerstone of your character. What is remarkable? What should be remembered? What is useful? What do you want to pass on? To answer these kinds of questions a little distance is helpful. Give yourself some space to tell the whole story.\n\nOvercoming cringe-worthy writing. When I read what I have written in the past, I cringe. That has held me back. It’s kept me from publishing. It's only natural to feel concerned. It's reasonable to expect judgment on my thoughts and how well I express them. My writing is a reflection of me.  I’ve found that when I cringe, it's actually evidence I’ve progressed as a writer. There is a delta between where I was as a writer and where I am today. I remind myself, I can always re-write. There is no such thing as great writing, only great rewriting.\n\nWrite. Have the discipline to write every day. Just writing will not make you a better writer but not writing is detrimental. Take it seriously. Take a writing class. Take more than one. Recognize that there are professional writers who have spent years honing the craft.  Respect writing as the skill that it is. Work at it.\n\nInexperience is a liability. I can’t sugarcoat that. It is. Business moves fast. Some degree of on-the-job training is expected but hiring managers have problems that they are hiring to solve. If you don’t have solutions...it’s going to be a tough sell. Don't wear inexperience on your sleeve, but don’t think you need to experience everything yourself. We do learn best from our own experience but we can leverage the experiences of others. A great place to start is Covey's two books on habits and of course subscribe to my blog.\n\nDefault to action. There's no time like the present. You're not promised tomorrow. None of us are. Today is all you have. Tomorrow doesn't exist. Each day you awake, it's today. Tomorrow never comes. The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is today. The same idea applies here.\nDefault to action. Fail splendidly. Learn. Do it again. It is easier to iterate and improve than to \"get it right\" the first time. Perfection is an illusion. Just get it done.\n\nYour stories and experience have value. In this post I’ve shared some ideas on how to unlock those stories:\nDefault to action\nPay attention to the chapter endings\nOvercome cringy-ness\nWrite\nUnlocking the stories is only part of the solution. Unlocking value is another part. In my next blog, I'll get into overcoming barriers to unlock and realize value.\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"July 8, 2021","title":"A Bespoke Throughput Dashboard","expertise":"Design","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\n​Let me tell you about a bespoke throughput dashboard I created: a cloud based Excel workbook that breaks out visualizations by activity which engages decision makers while maintaining accessibility.\n","hero_alt":"A Bespoke Throughput Dashboard","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#185868","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/087a7449af64ba8b02c5bc1e8678ec8e/6247c/design_3.png","srcSet":"/static/087a7449af64ba8b02c5bc1e8678ec8e/0c964/design_3.png 300w,\n/static/087a7449af64ba8b02c5bc1e8678ec8e/2bdcf/design_3.png 600w,\n/static/087a7449af64ba8b02c5bc1e8678ec8e/6247c/design_3.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/087a7449af64ba8b02c5bc1e8678ec8e/091a1/design_3.webp 300w,\n/static/087a7449af64ba8b02c5bc1e8678ec8e/763bf/design_3.webp 600w,\n/static/087a7449af64ba8b02c5bc1e8678ec8e/d7336/design_3.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":627}}}},"id":"afbdf985-d40d-5079-8b0a-a128893f4cf1","fields":{"slug":"design/bespoke-throughput-dashboard"},"parent":{"id":"b94f0601-55ac-50c6-98a6-28c171f18e17","name":"bespoke-throughput-dashboard","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:44:32.490Z"},"body":"Let me tell you about a bespoke throughput dashboard I created: a cloud based Excel workbook that breaks out visualizations by activity which engages decision makers while maintaining accessibility.\n\nIf you are familiar with Lean production, TPM, or the theory of constraints then you appreciate the need for a “Throughput Dashboard” to identify and manage constraints including the primary bottleneck. You understand that by focusing resources on optimizing and raising the capacity of the bottleneck you raise the productivity of the entire process. If you don’t, you should check out, The Goal by Eliyahu Goldratt (the Audiobook is fantastic!).\n\nOne of my team’s responsibilities is managing the primary bottleneck. To do that we use a throughput dashboard which looks alot like a calendar. The original calendar exists in Google Sheets. There is a tab for each month. The projects for each week are broken out by client and report type. The report types are color coded so you can see what you are getting on any given week. (See image directly below.)\n\nIt worked. It wasn’t intuitive, you needed some training to understand it because there was a lot going on. But it did the job and it worked. As our processes matured and our capacity increased we started to see our dashboard begin to buckle. Cracks were starting to form.\n\nThe new dashboard tracks projects at a granular level which allows us to dynamically reschedule projects into infinite combinations as needed. It tracks scheduling, rescheduling, & cancellations as separate records. This is all captured in one large table hidden in the background. Pivot tables aggregate the data into the various views as needed.\n\nThe first view is the Year At A Glance (See top image). Each open week has a green light. Closed weeks are indicated with red lights. This is all the information that most consultants need when scheduling. For management, and those who are curious additional detail is given.\n\nThere is a second table (also hidden) that scheduled capacity for the year. This table accounts for holidays and scheduled time off. Both this table and the main table are combined in the Excel Data Model to provide a joined Pivot that provides availability calculations for each week.\n\nThe second view is the weekly view (see below). This is a pivot table configured to breakout the projects for a given week. This allows each project to be seen at different levels of granularity. It includes a tool to facilitate delegating assignments.\n\nThe third view is a One on One view (see below). This view is new. It’s not possible on the original dashboard. It is also a pivot table that is configured with a slight variation on the filters to allow the consultants to see just the projects they have scheduled either for a given month or the rest of the year. This allows everyone to be on the same page with what has been planed.\n\nThis is version 3.0 of this throughput dashboard. It’s the first production version. It is fully accessible on the cloud. Future versions will include automation for scheduling new projects as well as additional visualizations. It isn't as sexy as what can be done in Tableau. It isn't designed to be. That is ok with me."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"July 8, 2021","title":"here be dragons","expertise":"Artificial Intelligence","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nAttempts at controlling extreme risk should come with a warning, here be dragons.\n","hero_alt":"here be dragons","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#c8d8c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/d77a67f9af79262ae0c16827c6219381/87706/data_savvy_dragons.png","srcSet":"/static/d77a67f9af79262ae0c16827c6219381/f80f8/data_savvy_dragons.png 320w,\n/static/d77a67f9af79262ae0c16827c6219381/9a63f/data_savvy_dragons.png 640w,\n/static/d77a67f9af79262ae0c16827c6219381/87706/data_savvy_dragons.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/d77a67f9af79262ae0c16827c6219381/c0bcc/data_savvy_dragons.webp 320w,\n/static/d77a67f9af79262ae0c16827c6219381/17574/data_savvy_dragons.webp 640w,\n/static/d77a67f9af79262ae0c16827c6219381/71d4d/data_savvy_dragons.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"ca32f350-b117-5894-a4ae-27be90d02344","fields":{"slug":"artificial_intelligence/here-be-dragons"},"parent":{"id":"cc3b102e-aab4-5a5b-a503-323f76b98579","name":"here-be-dragons","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:44:04.047Z"},"body":"\nHere be dragons. This phrase was often used by sailors to warn others of the dangers that lay ahead. They would put this phrase on maps to let other sailors know that they were entering uncharted territory, where there were many unknown risks. The same could be said for businesses that try to control their extreme risk. While it is certainly a good idea to take measures to minimize risk, it should come with a similar warning: here be dragons. Controlling extreme risk can be a dangerous game, and should not be taken lightly.\n\nSo what does it mean to \"control\" extreme risk? In business, this can take many forms, from insurance to hedging to diversification. It is important for businesses to understand the different types of risk control available to them, and how each one works. Different types of risk control will work better in different situations, so it is important to tailor the approach to the specific risks faced by the business. Taking a one-size-fits-all approach is usually not effective, and can often do more harm than good.\n\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"January 15, 2021","title":"Software Development for DataScientists","expertise":"Artificial Intelligence","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nAs a data scientist you are probably familiar with coding.

The first mention of it comes in Genesis 14, where Abram gave tithes to Melchizedek, the king of Salem.\n\nPaying tithing is [excellent fire insurance](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.23). We’ve also been promised that if we pay tithing, the blessings that come will be [more than we can receive](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10).\n\nIn the modern church, Joseph Smith received a revelation now known as [Doctrine and Covenants section 119](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119). In it, the Lord said:\n\n>Those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood.\n\nToday, we view that revelation to mean 10% of your income. But the law wasn’t always interpreted that way. And I’m not talking about how people used to tithe with eggs or potatoes or pigs. Rather, how much tithing you paid was based on your net worth.\n\nAs you’ve probably noticed, the church has made a push recently to publish more about its history in context. As part of that effort, Steven C. Harper from the Church History Department wrote an [article about tithing in the early days of the church](https://history.lds.org/article/the-tithing-of-my-people?lang=eng).\n\nHarper shares that after Edward Partridge heard the revelation in a Sunday reading, he wrote a letter to Newel K. Whitney. In it, he shared the law as applying to interest members would earn if they invested their net worth for a year:\n\n>“If a man is worth a $1000, the interest on that would be $60, and one/10. of the interest will be of course $6.” (6% was a common interest rate at the time)\n\nHere’s [another interesting article](https://juvenileinstructor.org/understanding-interest-in-joseph-smiths-original-tithing-revelation/) about the original intent of the revelation. It’s impossible to say when the church began to interpret the law of tithing as one-tenth of our income, but that is the current commandment.\n\n## Gross or net income?\n\nLike I said before, 10% isn’t as simple as it sounds. When having the discussion about whether you should pay your tithing on gross or net income, it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve heard the question: “Well, do you want gross or net blessings?”\n\nThis question is always rhetorical (who’s going to say they want net blessings?) and usually ends the conversation. I heard it for the first time shortly before my mission. I resolved then and there that I’d always qualify for gross blessings.\n\nWhen we married, my wife said something about paying on net income, but I wouldn’t have it. Then, a couple years ago, my wife and I were in a bishop’s office going over our budget. We needed a little financial assistance from the ward and were happy to walk through our income and expenses with the bishop.\n\nHe first asked me what my take-home pay was. After I told him, he automatically calculated our tithing based on that amount. I was confused. Does my bishop pay on net? Didn’t he want gross blessings?!\n\n## The church’s stance on tithing\n\nIn fact, the church has no official stance on whether you should pay tithing on your gross or net income. This is the statement the First Presidency made in 1970. As of yet, nothing has superseded it:\n\n>“The simplest statement we know of is the statement of the Lord himself, namely, that the members of the Church should pay ‘one-tenth of all their interest annually,’ which is understood to mean income. No one is justified in making any other statement than this.\n\n>“Every member of the Church is entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the Lord and to make payment accordingly.”\n\nIn other words, how you define your income for tithing purposes is between you and God. It’s not up to your bishop, your stake president or any of the general authorities to decide for you. Of course, some of these men may have opinions on how you should calculate your income. But they’re not justified in setting that number for anyone but themselves.\n\n## Keep it simple\n\nThings can get really complicated if you spend too much time calculating your income. For example, what happens if you pay on gross income but die before you receive Social Security income and Medicare coverage. Was that Social Security and Medicare tax actually income?\n\nAnd what if you don’t get a tax refund, should the federal and state income tax you paid the previous year be no longer be considered income? What about investment income that’s not yet realized because you haven’t withdrawn it from the account? If the stock market crashes the next year and you lose all those unrealized gains, were they really income in the first place?\n\nOK, let’s take a deep breath before you and I pop a blood vessel thinking about all of this. When doing tithing settlement at the end of the year, the bishop won’t ask you for a W-2 form or tax return to verify your “full tithe” declaration. And that’s how it’s supposed to be. You don’t need to get all intense in determining what’s income and what isn’t. Simplicity is, after all, a principle of the Gospel. Do what you feel comfortable with.\n\nAnd the next time someone shares the “gross or net blessings” argument, share this with them 😉\n\nWith the official statement of the church in mind, that kind of argument effectively seeks to take away a person’s agency. It makes them believe that they may be robbing God or will receive lesser blessings for paying on their net income. That’s just not true. However you decide to pay your tithing, do it prayerfully and honestly. That’s all God asks for.\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"January 3, 2019","title":"What Should You Pay Tithing On?","expertise":"My Journey","author":"James M.

Dahle, MD. He blogs at [The White Coat Investor](www.whitecoatinvestor.com/), and also wrote “The White Coat Investor: A Doctor’s Guide to Personal Finance and Investing.”\n\nWhen it comes to tithing, my belief aligns with the 1970 First Presidency letter on the subject: “Every member of the Church is entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the Lord and to make payment accordingly.”\n\nDahle’s analytical perspective is a fun read. These are some interesting things to consider.\n\nI have been writing a blog where I help doctors and other high-income professionals stop doing dumb things with their money for the last six years. It is the most widely read physician-specific personal finance and investing website in the world.\n\nOver that time period, many of my readers have figured out that I’m Mormon. As such, they ask me for my thoughts on tithing. I suspect I have spent more time thinking about tithing than anyone else on the planet.\n\nThe only discussions I ever see in both Sunday school classes or on the internet seem to center around the [gross versus net question](/thoughts/tithing-should-you-pay-on-your-gross-or-net-income). However, tithing can be way more complicated than that. In fact, it can be so complicated, that every time I think about it I see the wisdom in the common recommendation that it’s between you and God.\n\n**That recommendation is where I will start and finish this discussion.** In the middle, we’ll dive deep into the topic and discuss some questions you’ve probably had and probably a few you’ve never thought about.\n\n## The basics of tithing\n\nA tithe is 10% of your income that you pay to the church. It pays for things like:\n\n- Chapels\n- Temples\n- Printed materials\n- Church employee salaries\n- Other expenses required to run a worldwide church\n\nFor the devout Mormon, a tithe is a commandment. If you don’t pay your tithing in full, you can’t go to our most sacred of buildings, the temple.\n\nHowever, tithing comes with a promise. As God said through his prophet Malachi:\n\n>Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse…and prove me now herewith…if I will not…pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it….I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground….and all nations shall call you blessed.\n\nSo, tithing is a commandment, and we can expect to be blessed for keeping it.The implication seems to be that the blessing is both temporal and spiritual.\n\nSunday school is full of stories of latter-day saints who paid their tithing despite financial challenges and then were rewarded financially for doing so. And if that isn’t enough of a blessing, it also serves as fire insurance in the second coming, as noted in Doctrine and Covenants 64:23.\n\n## Extra tithing = extra blessings?\n\nIf you’ve been in the church for a long time, what I’ve written above probably isn’t new to you. What I’ll cover from here probably is. Note that tithing has repeatedly been defined at 10%. Pay 9%, you aren’t obeying the commandment. Pay 11%, no extra blessings. It’s 10%. So for a Mormon, calculating 10% tends to become somewhat of an exact science. Most Mormons calculate their tithing to the dollar, if not the penny.\n\n## Your benefits\ns\nHere’s something you W-2 employees out there have probably never thought about. Your employer likely offers some benefits. Maybe a retirement match, a flexible savings account, life insurance, disability insurance, “free” meals, or health insurance. Your employer also pays half of the payroll tax (Social Security and Medicare) as well as unemployment tax.\n\nAre those a business expense or are they part of your salary? If you bought those things on the open market, you would be doing so with post-tax (and presumably post-tithing) dollars. So why does the fact that your employer gives them to you change how much you pay in tithing?\n\nIn this respect, a self-employed Mormon is at a disadvantage. I doubt any employed person is adding the employer half of his Social Security taxes back to his gross income before calculating his tithing, much less the unknown employer portion of his family’s health insurance premium.\n\nSo perhaps the self-employed person should be subtracting those costs out of his gross income before calculating his tithing. I also haven’t paid tithing on free meals and similar benefits, mostly just because of the hassle factor of doing so.\n\n### Social Security\n\nIf you are paying tithing on your Social Security and Medicare taxes, do you also plan to pay tithing on the benefits? I don’t. That’s not an increase; that’s just getting my money back. (Yes, I know the Social Security calculations are complex and you may be getting back more or less than you paid in, even when adjusting for the time value of money.)\n\n### Insurance premiums and benefits\n\nHere’s another dilemma when you start spending too much time thinking about tithing. In general, when you pay the premiums on an insurance policy with pre-tax dollars, the benefits are taxable. If you pay with post-tax dollars, the benefits are tax-free. If we’re only paying tithing on increase, that’s probably the way it ought to work.\n\nSo do you deduct your insurance premiums from your income before calculating tithing and then pay on any benefits received, or do you pay with post-tithing dollars and accept the benefits tithing-free? I’ve chosen to do the latter, mostly just because the accounting is easier!\n\n### Retirement accounts\n\nWhen I started earning money and using retirement accounts, I realized it would be crazy difficult to keep track of my tithing basis for contributions. So I decided to just plan to pay tithing when I take money out of retirement accounts like 401(k)s and Roth IRAs.\n\nI look at it as deferred salary (even if it is a Roth account.) Contributions to those plans are basically tithing “deductions” on my tithing spreadsheet. I’ll pay on it when I take withdrawals from it.\n\n### Coverdell Education Savings Accounts and 529s\n\nI took a similar approach to education savings accounts. However, they bring in an additional complication. You’re only allowed to take out, at least tax and penalty free, an amount from the 529 or Coverdell as what was spent on legitimate educational expenses. There’s no allowance for an extra 10%.\n\nI have not yet figured out how to deal with that other than the fact that I don’t plan to pay for every single dime of my children’s education using 529 money. So I should have the educational costs to pull a little more out of the account because the kid’s or my own earnings will be paying some of the cost. Or more likely, I can just make it up with other income.\n\n### Health savings accounts\n\nThese triple-tax-free accounts are pretty awesome. But they have the same issue as a 529: You can only make withdrawals tax and penalty free the same amount of money as you spend on health care. In other words, you can’t take out an extra 10% to pay tithing.\n\nIf it’s a small part of your income, no big deal. If you pull out $100,000 to pay for some crazy experimental medical treatment your insurance won’t cover, however, finding $10,000 to pay tithing with might be a little tougher.\n\n### Capital gains and losses\n\nPart of the issue with capital gains is that, especially for something you’ve owned for a long time, a large part of those capital gains are just inflation. That’s not really an increase at all. So I actually adjust my capital gains for inflation before calculating my tithing. I also subtract my capital losses from my income before calculating my tithing.\n\nOwned a house for 20 years and it doubled in value? If inflation went up 50% in that time period, perhaps you should only pay tax on 25% of the house value. What about significant home improvements? Should they be added to your tithing basis just like they would to your tax basis for a rental property? Maybe they should, although I can’t say I’ve ever done that.\n\n### Other random bits of increase\n\nWhat about other stuff, like scholarships or grants? Or the fact that two-thirds of the cost of education at BYU is paid by tithing. Or that your degree at a state university is subsidized by your state? What about birthday gifts and Christmas presents? What if you don’t know what the present cost? What about credit card rewards points, free miles for signing up for a credit card, or a voucher given to you for missing your flight?\n\nI don’t typically tithe on any of these things. It’s just too big of an accounting hassle. I think the Lord understands.\n\n## The best way to pay tithing\n\nThe best way to pay tithing is to donate appreciated shares from a taxable (non-qualified) account directly to the church. The “in-kind donations” office takes care of all that, and the church has an account at every major brokerage or mutual fund company that makes the share transfer easy.\n\nThe benefit of doing so is that you don’t have to pay capital gains taxes on those shares and neither does the church. But you still get to deduct the full value of the donation on Schedule A. Cool trick, eh? Of course, don’t forget to pay tithing on the inflation-adjusted increase in value of those shares!\n\n## How often to pay tithing\n\nYou visit with your bishop once a year for tithing settlement, so I see no reason to pay more than once a year. It makes for some really big tithing checks (unless I’ve donated shares that year) but it sure makes for easier bookkeeping.\n\nJust don’t raid that tithing fund for some other expense during the year. You might need that fire insurance! Of course, be sure to pay tithing on the interest earned by that money during the year.\n\n## Marginal tax + tithing rate\n\nYour marginal tax rate is useful for determining all kinds of things. For example, at very high marginal tax rates many of us decide to work less. It just isn’t worth it when 46% of everything you earn goes to the government. For a Mormon, some of those decisions should be made by adding your tithing rate to your tax rate. Now 56% of the next dollar you earn goes somewhere else.\n\nWell, not entirely true, since you can probably deduct a good chunk of that tithing check against your taxes, so maybe it’s only 51%. But either way, Mormons, despite their Sunday school lessons on industry, service, and work, have more incentive than others to earn less.\n\n## Tithing can be complicated\n\nNow you can see the wisdom in “it’s between you and God,” right? So as you come upon these decisions in your financial life, figure out what you would feel fine about if you were handing your check directly to God, and then don’t feel a bit bad declaring yourself a full tithe payer. Most of your ward probably hasn’t considered half of this stuff in calculating their tithing donation."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"July 30, 2018","title":"A Python Murder Mystery","expertise":"Analytics Engineering","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nCoding up a script that uses natural language processing techniques (NLP) to analyse letters to find a killer.\n","hero_alt":"A Python Murder Mystery","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/0a37f41a9cca69dcc56fdbd92a1a03c3/87706/development_python.png","srcSet":"/static/0a37f41a9cca69dcc56fdbd92a1a03c3/f80f8/development_python.png 320w,\n/static/0a37f41a9cca69dcc56fdbd92a1a03c3/9a63f/development_python.png 640w,\n/static/0a37f41a9cca69dcc56fdbd92a1a03c3/87706/development_python.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/0a37f41a9cca69dcc56fdbd92a1a03c3/c0bcc/development_python.webp 320w,\n/static/0a37f41a9cca69dcc56fdbd92a1a03c3/17574/development_python.webp 640w,\n/static/0a37f41a9cca69dcc56fdbd92a1a03c3/71d4d/development_python.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"ee31f8ea-fd73-5243-a4f9-1cba986d2d28","fields":{"slug":"analytics_engineering/python-murder-mystery"},"parent":{"id":"841e7434-3c50-5365-bba3-5ce6b16714d8","name":"python-murder-mystery","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:44:15.143Z"},"body":"## Jay Stacksby is dead.\n\nMurdered on his isolated personal island, Jay Stacksby, billionaire and reality T.V. star, is dead.

The murder left a note at the scene of the crime:\n\n## The note.\n\n> You may call me heartless, a killer, a monster, a murderer, but I'm still NOTHING compared to the villian that Jay was. This whole contest was a sham, an elaborate plot to shame the contestants and feed Jay's massive, massive ego. SURE you think you know him! You've seen him smiling for the cameras, laughing, joking, telling stories, waving his money around like a prop but off camera he was a sinister beast, a cruel cruel taskmaster, he treated all of us like slaves, like cattle, like animals! Do you remember Lindsay, she was the first to go, he called her such horrible things that she cried all night, keeping up all up, crying, crying, and more crying, he broke her with his words. I miss my former cast members, all of them very much. And we had to live with him, live in his home, live in his power, deal with his crazy demands. AND FOR WHAT! DID YOU KNOW THAT THE PRIZE ISN'T REAL? He never intended to marry one of us! The carrot on the stick was gone, all that was left was stick, he told us last night that we were all a terrible terrible disappointment and none of us would ever amount to anything, and that regardless of who won the contest he would never speak to any of us again! It's definitely the things like this you can feel in your gut how wrong he is! Well I showed him, he got what he deserved all right, I showed him, I showed him the person I am! I wasn't going to be pushed around any longer, and I wasn't going to let him go on pretending that he was some saint when all he was was a sick sick twisted man who deserved every bit of what he got. The fans need to know, Jay Stacksby is a vile amalgamation of all things evil and bad and the world is a better place without him. ~ The killer\n\nPretty sinister stuff! In addition to this bold-faced admission, we have the introduction letters of the three contestants. Maybe there is a way to use this information to determine who the author of this murder letter is?\n\n## The Suspects\n\n> Salutations. My name? Myrtle. Myrtle Beech. I am a woman of simple tastes. I enjoy reading, thinking, and doing my taxes. I entered this competition because I want a serious relationship. I want a commitment. The last man I dated was too whimsical. He wanted to go on dates that had no plan. No end goal. Sometimes we would just end up wandering the streets after dinner. He called it a \"walk\". A \"walk\" with no destination. Can you imagine? I like every action I take to have a measurable effect. When I see a movie, I like to walk away with insights that I did not have before. When I take a bike ride, there better be a worthy destination at the end of the bike path. Jay seems frivolous at times. This worries me. However, it is my staunch belief that one does not make and keep money without having a modicum of discipline. As such, I am hopeful. I will now list three things I cannot live without. Water. Emery boards. Dogs. Thank you for the opportunity to introduce myself. I look forward to the competition. ~ Myrtle Beech\n\n> Hi, I'm Lily Trebuchet from East Egg, Long Island. I love cats, hiking, and curling up under a warm blanket with a book. So they gave this little questionnaire to use for our bios so lets get started. What are some of my least favorite household chores? Dishes, oh yes it's definitely the dishes, I just hate doing them, don't you? Who is your favorite actor and why? Hmm, that's a hard one, but I think recently I'll have to go with Michael B. Jordan, every bit of that man is handsome, HANDSOME! Do you remember seeing him shirtless? I can't believe what he does for the cameras! Okay okay next question, what is your perfect date? Well it starts with a nice dinner at a delicious but small restaurant, you know like one of those places where the owner is in the back and comes out to talk to you and ask you how your meal was. My favorite form of art? Another hard one, but I think I'll have to go with music, music you can feel in your whole body and it is electrifying and best of all, you can dance to it! Okay final question, let's see, What are three things you cannot live without? Well first off, my beautiful, beautiful cat Jerry, he is my heart and spirit animal. Second is pasta, definitely pasta, and the third I think is my family, I love all of them very much and they support me in everything I do. I know Jay Stacksby is a handsome man and all of us want to be the first to walk down the aisle with him, but I think he might truly be the one for me. Okay that's it for the bio, I hope you have fun watching the show! ~ Lily Trebuchet\n\n> A most good day to you all, I am Gregg T Fishy, of the Fishy Enterprise fortune. I am 37 years young, an adventurous spirit and I've never lost my sense of childlike wonder. I do love to be in the backyard gardening and I have the most extraordinary time when I'm fishing. Fishing for what, you might find yourself asking? Why, I happen to always be fishing for compliments of course! I have a stunning pair of radiant blue eyes that will pierce the soul of anyone who dare gaze upon my countenance. I quite enjoy going on long jaunts through garden paths and short walks through greenhouses. I hope that Jay will be as absolutely interesting as he appears on the television, I find that he has some of the most curious tastes in style and humor. When I'm out and about I quite enjoy hearing tales that instill in my heart of hearts the fascination that beguiles my every day life, every fiber of my being scintillates and vascillates with extreme pleasure during one of these charming anecdotes and significantly pleases my beautiful personage. I cannot wait to enjoy being on the television program A Jay To Remember, it certainly seems like a grand time to explore life and love. ~ Gregg T. Fishy\n\n## Can You Find the Killer?\n\nThis is my final project for my Codecademy Python class. I am coding up a script that uses natural language processing techniques (NLP) to analyse each letter and find out which contestant is the killer.\n\nBefore I started coding I read through each introduction and the murderer's note a few times.

Here are some take aways i clipped from social media posts:\n\n> “The “marshmallow test” is really an “affluence/privilege test.”\n\n> “Poorer kids would be less motivated to wait...b/c life holds fewer guarantees:  a second marshmallow seems irrelevant when a child has reason to believe that the first one might vanish.”\n\n> “Turns out children's family economic security--not their individual grit--is a reliable predictor of their long-term success.”\n\nMy friends, you hit a nerve. My frayed, exposed nerve. You might call this a rant. This gets in the face of the American fable: work hard, persevere, succeed. At first it was hard to swallow because I believe the fable. But now I’ve taken time to ponder. From discomfort my feelings have transformed. Now I’m pissed.\n\nSeparate the research from the politics.\n\nThe research suggests that grit is not a cause but rather a correlated outcome. One’s background, not the ability to delay gratification (grit), drives long-term success. Circumstances matter. Among kids whose mothers had a college degree, those who waited for a second marshmallow did no better in the long run than those who dug right in.\nAmong kids whose mothers did not have college degrees, those who waited did no better than those who gave in to temptation. For those kids, self-control alone couldn’t overcome economic and social disadvantages.\n\nThat can all be true. Let’s go one further, it’s true. A given fact, rich kids have more advantage.\n\nWhat now?\n\nWhat do you tell that poor kid with the teenage mom and no dad?\n\nThe Atlantic has a message for that kid. Read the last sentence of the article: for poor children, indulging in a small bit of joy today can make life feel more bearable, especially when there’s no guarantee of more joy tomorrow. It isn’t intentional. Admittedly, I’ve  taken the sentence out of context. Doesn’t matter. The subtext is there. The message is poor children are poor thru no fault of their own (true) and they are powerless to do anything about it (um . . . not true).\n\nI can’t support that. The american fable is replete with examples of people who have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps. So what do you say to that poor kid with the teenage mom whose dad isn’t in his life? Give up, there is nothing you can do. Really? Do you believe that? Here is an odd thought. Instead of coming up with an answer maybe listen to what he has to say. Specifically what one such kid has to say to his own son.\n\n## Greatness Is Upon You\n\nThis is one of my favorite people on the planet, Eric Thomas. When I’m down he is my best kept secret. I’ve watched this video countless times.\n\n[![Greatness is Upon You](./media/content/greatness_video.png)](https://youtu.be/Oy0Lj7RkjkU)\n\nsn’t Eric talking about the exact same thing as the study? He is. It was easy for Eric to drop out of school because his dad dropped out. As did his grandfather. He hates school but, he is getting his PhD. Why? Because he understands that his son’s success is tied to his own success. **Greatness is here.**\n\n## I Didn’t Get Here By Making Excuses.\n\nThe Atlantic is on some bullsh*t because the only thing you can control in this life is yourself. They are effectively taking that away. They want to feed you excuses. Will you take the bait? You will if you don’t know [what you want](/thoughts/inspire-action). You owe it to yourself to know.\n\n[![You Owe You](./media/content/you_owe_you_video.png)](https://youtu.be/7Oxz060iedY)\n\n[Find out what you want](/thoughts/inspire-action) and then spend the rest of your natural life waking up and going after it. But you don’t want to hear that, do you? You don’t want to hear about the guy who wakes up at 2:30 in the morning to grind for the same opportunities you were given. You want to hear about 5 tips and tricks to make life easier. You want the life-hacks, not [the life-hammer](/thoughts/inspire-action).\n\nI was that kid. I decided I wasn’t going to be disadvantaged as a statistic but rather I was going to take the advantage with statistics. I accepted the grind, the fight, the work, to do everything in my power to press forward every single day and learn what I’m missing along the way. Because winners win. And losers lose. I didn’t get here making excuses. I wake up and I grind. No alarm clock required: my passion wakes me up.\n\n> I decided I wasn’t going to be disadvantaged as a statistic but rather I was going to take the advantage with statistics.\n\nI live in America. I am a hispanic male. They don’t treat us the same, something called racism. I’m not crying about it. There will be racism until the day I die. I am not going to cry about it; I’m still going to be a millionaire. I’m still going to be one of the top data professionals in the world. No I didn’t grow up on that side of the town. My mom doesn’t have a network. I don’t “know people.” I’m not at a country club. I don’t play golf. I’m still going to be successful. I’m still going to get to where they are because I owe it to myself. Nobody can stop me but me.\n\n## Take Your Shot\n\nTo succeed you only have to hit life hard one good time in the mouth. But you need to hang in there until you get your shot. When your shot comes around, take it.\n\n[![Take Your Shot](./media/content/take_the_shot_video.png)](https://youtu.be/G_CDIQuM_vQ)\n\nThis week I heard the story for the first time. The time Eric Thomas learned greatness was upon him. This is his origin story. Pastor Willis takes this homeless 17 year old high school dropout and with love tells him to get his GED and go to college. He says, “because greatness is upon you.” 17 years old. Living in an abandoned building. Smelly, because he doesn’t shower. Bad breath from eating garbage and not brushing after. Pastor Willis says, “Greatness is Upon You.” And now he who was admonished uses his gift to admonish us.\n\nSo what do you say to the kid whose mother doesn't have a college degree? Those who wait for the marshmallow will fare no better than those who give in. Self-control alone will not overcome economic and social disadvantage. What do you say? What do you say to yourself? That kid inside you? What. do. you. say.\n\nGreatness. Is. Upon. You.\n\nThe Atlantic makes a classic error. Winners focus on winning. Losers focus on winners.\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"May 18, 2018","title":"Mom, Happy Mother’s Day!","expertise":"My Journey","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nMy mom is . .. \n","hero_alt":"Mom, Happy Mother’s Day!","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#f8f8f8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/57faef8ac6302d8bdbdc62ef86613c95/87706/power_of_one.png","srcSet":"/static/57faef8ac6302d8bdbdc62ef86613c95/f80f8/power_of_one.png 320w,\n/static/57faef8ac6302d8bdbdc62ef86613c95/9a63f/power_of_one.png 640w,\n/static/57faef8ac6302d8bdbdc62ef86613c95/87706/power_of_one.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/57faef8ac6302d8bdbdc62ef86613c95/c0bcc/power_of_one.webp 320w,\n/static/57faef8ac6302d8bdbdc62ef86613c95/17574/power_of_one.webp 640w,\n/static/57faef8ac6302d8bdbdc62ef86613c95/71d4d/power_of_one.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"ada1976a-4146-54d3-ae77-71026d99e205","fields":{"slug":"my_journey/mothers-day-2018"},"parent":{"id":"30efeebe-b731-526d-8ed6-633a53a052ab","name":"mothers-day-2018","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:38:52.466Z"},"body":"## My mom is good at:\n\nGardening.

While the message has not changed the medium has. \nReading Rainbow launched as a television series that aired from 1983 to 2009. \nBut LeVar’s vision for the message has moved to mobile, tablets, even VR and gaming. \nThere was even a nice reference to the holodeck.\n\nThe old model of creating books from trees is not sustainable. He urges the audience to embrace digital media. \nHe speaks about the power of visual media and the power of video games. \nMoving pictures and sounds can tell a story on multiple levels, conscious and unconscious. \nVideo games, he says, is where kids are going to absorb the myths of our culture. \nHe concludes, “I don’t want to read on the internet tonight that LeVar says we are getting rid of books.” The medium may change but the message is the same:\n\nThe stories we tell inform who we are, why we’re here, and where we’re going. The stories we tell reveal what our contribution will be.\n\nHe talks about the emphasis on STEM. He advocates for us to update our thinking to STEAM: Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS, and Math. He then ups the ante one more time introducing STREAM. The R is for . . . reading. You might say well of course reading. Reading is fundamental to the rest. That is the point.\n \n## Reading is the fundamental to learning.\n \nFor a young LeVar Burton, reading was a vehicle. His mother, Erma Jean Burton, was a voracious reader. She instilled this fundamental skill in him. Erma Jean had high expectations for her son: “I am the man that I am because she was the woman that she was.” She knew that as person of color LeVar faced grim realities. Reading empowered a young LeVar to face these realities. Reading gave him access to a story: “The story my mother told me. The story I embraced.” Reading empowered him with access to lifelong learning:\n\n>“A lifelong learner is a dangerous person indeed.”\n\nOur human superpower is the ability to imagine ourselves in the past, alternate presents and future. There is an inextricable link between what we imagine and what we create. Stories shape our imagination.\n \n## How To Tell Powerful Stories\n \nI was really hoping to get some tips on writing more powerful stories. \nI will say this. \nEvery sentence of his remarks could be a tweet. Very precise. \nHe told a series of stories from his life. Now when I think of a story, I think plot. His stories where character driven. \nHe talked about important people in his life and those people informed the story. \nThree of those people he identified as storytelling mentors: [Gene Roddenberry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0M-yp0eORc)\n, [Alex Haley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIS_d9yJRdM)\n, and [Fred Rodgers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKy7ljRr0AA)\n.\n \n## Read, Ponder, Pray\n\nHe concluded with what I took as his version of the LDS mantra, read-ponder-pray:\n\n>Be still, stand in love, and pay attention. Love is the only sane response to the human experience.\n\nBut you don’t have to take my word for it.\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"May 6, 2018","title":"Happy Birthday!","expertise":"My Journey","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nThis might not be for everyone, but it is more likely for you since we are friends.

Mckinsey predicts a shortfall in meeting the demand for 1.5 million data savvy managers. According to the American Management Association 75% of companies report they are ill-equipped to meet current analytics needs. Here are six skills tech startups are looking for in a data savvy manager: listen, ask great questions, understand data science, evaluate alternatives, acknowledge and mitigate bias,  and catalyze change.\n\nA major hurdle to iterate and improve strategic data driven decision making is people. Data analytics is pretty straight forward; i.e. math is just that, math. It's people (humans) that can be challenging. Which means people (could that be you?) are the solution. Data science relies heavily on statistical computing. Scripts and math. Algorithms. If (1) you start with good data and (2) you have a competent data scientist conduct and interpret the analysis, you still need (3) to put those results into context; make something happen. Someone has to do! Teams (doers) need to execute on insights.\n\nThe good news is that you don’t have to know how to code or do advanced maths to become data-savvy. In fact, you don’t have to be particularly tech savvy at all. What you do have to do is adopt a data-friendly mindset. Whether you are looking to lead the way as a data-savvy employee, or lead the charge for culture change as a manager or C-level executive, here are some suggestions for encouraging everyone in your organization to become data savvy.\n\n## Six skills tech startups are looking for in data savvy managers\n\n**Listen.** Understand the problems your team, senior, & mid-level managers are facing.\n\n**Ask great questions.** Focus on how to ask the right questions rather than the method of arriving at the answers. Frame the problem into a set of questions that, if answered, direct action. Understand (& communicate) that decisions must be made once these questions are answered. Help other managers to do the same. A data-savvy manager structures a strategic problem and facilitates discussion to reach an actionable resolution or decision. Strategic questions and sub-questions will drive the analytic process and must always be clearly tied back to the business need and desired outcome.\n\n**Understand data science.** Some basic understanding of what data is and how it is collected is all that is needed to start to see the bigger picture.  If you can store it, you can analyse it; so what data do you already store in your job? What could you learn from it?Take a survey level course on data science. LinkedIn Learning offers a course that you can get through in an afternoon. When you understand the process you can ask actionable questions that lend themselves to be answered with a data model.\n\nIn the planning phase, data-savvy managers must consider how to strategically advance the data decision process. By understanding the data platform and clear objectives for the data needs, the manager will be able to communicate effectively with the scientists or engineers and drive the needed data collection, modeling and analysis, based on the desired outcome.\n\nHaving an understanding of the platform and the vision of what can be achieved, a data-savvy manager can identify opportunities to continue building out the desired analytical platform and the resources to further develop their data decision.\n\n**Acknowledge and mitigate bias.** Team members have (and use) inherent bias. Teams that manage group-think will naturally make better evaluations. Recognize and mitigate the inherent biases team members have. Involve the project team early in workshops for critical thinking and creative problem solving. Have them offer insights into biases and identify required resources upfront. Involving the whole team allows discussion to focus around the strategic problem and ultimately get its buy in on the plan moving forward. Early buy-in is important for establishing accountability and responsibility throughout the process.\n\n**Catalyze change.** Communicate and empower decisions throughout the organization. The most common problem is the role the organizational culture plays in utilizing analytics. Senior managers, mid-level managers and technical personnel all share responsibility for developing a culture to implement these decisions quickly. Employees, whether technically skilled or not, should recognize that data has the potential to impact every aspect of the business. Champion this message throughout the organization and begin shifting the organizational culture to one that is data decision-oriented. Achieving early small wins can lead to big victories toward ultimately changing the organizational culture through the demonstration of value created for the firm and others.\n\n## Data Savvy Managers Drive Processes\n\nThese six skills are crucial to developing processes.  If you're in finance, you need analytics for risk; supply chain, then you need optimization; for marketing, customer segmentation. You can see the demand and the need. While each vertical has it's own nuance, each process has these four components in common:\n\n- generate meaningful questions\n- pose those questions effectively\n- build understanding around data driven decisions\n- create a culture that can implement those decisions\n\nPeople in a variety of roles are starting to understand the value of being data-savvy. Data is already becoming ubiquitous in business as well as in daily life. It used to be that the IT department could be contained to its own office or floor, but today, it’s becoming harder and harder to segregate the realm of data from any other aspect of business. That means that data — and the application and analysis of said data — is going to become more and more important in every department, from sales to HR and from R&D to marketing:\n\n- Predictive analytics: Using past and current data to answer questions about the future\n- Scorecarding: Tracking business metrics against strategic and operational outcomes for better decision making\n- Dashboards: Real-time presentations and aggregations of relevant data\n- Social analytics: Metrics from social media and networks\n- Content analytics: Assessment of available content and how it is used\n- Web analytics: Tracking traffic and key words used to find particular sites\n\nDifferent kinds of data and analyses can be used to influence behavior, improve organizational policies and practices, or make better decisions. Processes within a business are generally places where you generate a lot of data and can manage data more efficiently. These can be great places to get staff on board with a new data-centric culture.\n\n## There is no such thing as \"perfect data\"\n\nData newbies need to be taught and reminded that there are always anomalies in data sets, and that data needs to go through quality control and be cleaned before it is useful. Building these concepts and processes in from the start will eliminate big headaches later. Just accepting this fact will reduce headaches. Before you can analyse data it needs to be cleaned, (wrangled or munged). Data wrangling is 80% of the work.\n\n## A data savvy manager doesn't have to code or be a math expert\n\nData scientists are “deep analytical talent”: people with solid backgrounds in applied math, economics, or life science. They are skeptical, communicative, curious, and creative. They know more statistics than engineers and more engineering than statisticians. Data savvy professionals, on the other hand, have these qualities but not the same level of technical training. They can think of problems as data-driven or analytical. They know how to think about data, how to ask the right questions and challenge the answers they receive. In short, data science requires rare (specialist) qualities:\n\n- an ability to take unstructured data and find order, meaning, and value.\n\n- Deep analytical talent.\n\nData Savvy doesn't. a data-savvy manager incorporate all of the information into the decision-making process. Whether it is information marketing will use for customer segmentation, or research and development for knowledge discovery, there must be an avenue for the information to be incorporated into the decision making process. A data-savvy manager must structure the process with the end in mind.\n\nData savvy doesn't require you to code or be a math expert, check out my learner's guide to becoming a data savvy manager.

If you would like, I have a FREE Data Warehousing for Dummies PDF that takes you through the whole process. Today, I want to talk about an important question, “Should you build one large database of information (a data warehouse) and then parcel off smaller portions to different organizations, or should you build a bunch of smaller scale databases (data marts) and then integrate them together later?”\n\nIf you say to yourself:\n\n“Go big or go home. We are building a Costco size warehouse.” OR “ We want a data mart, not a warehouse.”\n\nThen you are starting off on the wrong foot. It is easy to think in terms of big or small. It is better to think in terms of the answers you are looking for.\n\n## Answers to Specific Business Questions\n\nOften the answer to a handful of business questions drives an organization’s operations. Jim Rohn used to say, “There are always about a half dozen things that makes 80% of the difference in any area of your life.” Look for the few things that make the most difference, and spend the most of your time on those few things.\n\nBusiness questions that carry this kind of weight are often analysed in Excel. \n\n> “There are always about a half dozen things that makes 80% of the difference in any area of your life.” ~ Jim Rohn\n\nThe most democratic data analysis tool in use today is Excel. Virtually everyone has access to Excel. You may fire up Excel to consolidate and check the information you dig up in order to summarize and organize it. This type of “spread-mart” lacks the repeatability and data quality for anything more than a single serve analysis of one moment in time. Sounds like a job for a data warehouse!\n\nFor your first project, consider a small scale data mart designed specifically to answer these high impact, high value, “How are we doing?” type of questions.\n\n## When A Data Warehouse is the better choice.\n\nUntil you understand the following three issues, you have no basis on deciding what investment to make:\n\nThe business problem you are trying to solve; the questions you are trying to answer.\nThe business value you expect to gain when your system is successfully built.\nThe volumes and characteristics of the data you need.\n\nWhen considering the volume and characteristics of the data you need it can be helpful to think in terms of data sources. A small business can have anywhere from 8 to 10 sources, some examples: Quickbooks, Google Analytics, WordPress, Activecampaign, Amazon Affiliate Marketplace, Facebook, Twitter, Salesforce CRM, Survey Monkey, etc. Once you have asked your handful of questions, are the answers easier to get from one integrated database or a pair of independent databases?\n\nA quick note on sources vs subject areas. In the last paragraph we listed out some data sources. An example of a subject area is “Marketing.” Marketing makes use of two data sources:Facebook and Google Analytics. A data mart can service one at most two subject areas. Most businesses have at least 5 subject areas: Marketing, Sales, Fulfilment, Customer Service, & Finance. To address three or more subject areas requires a data warehouse.\n\n## Business Intelligence Tools\n\nData Mart users usually ask questions with a “Tell me what happened” perspective. They require reports and don’t do much heavy analytical processing. On the other hand, there are a variety of different ways to look at the contents of a warehouses because it collects data on a broad range of subject areas:\n\nSimple Reporting. Just like a data mart, the goal is “Tell me what happened?”\nBusiness Analysis. Not just, “Tell me what happened?” but also, “Why?”\nDashboards & ScoreCards. The warehouse gathers a variety of information and consolidates it: “Tell me a lot of things, but don’t make me work for it.”\nData Mining. In addition to, statistical analysis, econometrics, machine learning, AI, data mining is generally about taking large volumes of data and sifting through it to separate knowledge from the noise, often without even having to ask a specific question: “Tell me something interesting.”\n\nTool vendors increasingly try to provide suites of products to handle as many of these different functions as possible, you will need to deal with different products. Don’t assume that you can select a single vendor whose products satisfy all the business intelligence capabilities your users need. Carefully check out the vendors’ products - all of them.\n\n## Benefits of a Data Mart\n\nI started off asking about what kind on investment you should make in your data, to start. The answer depends on what key pieces of information you need to run your business. Once you know the answers you are looking for, then you can look at the data you have to go about getting those answers. Data marts are preferable to warehouses for three reasons:\n\nSpeed. These are typically completed in 90 to 120 days. Full scale warehouses take considerably longer.\nCost. Simple is fast. Fast is cheaper.\nRisk. When you work with less data, fewer sources, over a shorter period of time you have a less complex environment - fewer associated risks.\n\nIn reality most “real” data investments involve a warehouse that covers all five subject areas I listed before: Marketing, Sales, Fulfillment, Customer Service, & Finance.

Last week I started a new series on this blog exploring big data solutions for small business. My first step is creating a data warehouse. This week I wanted to get into a little more about what a data warehouse is.\n\nAs I am building out and iterating my own data warehousing for dummies PDF, I am reading the official for Dummies book and I don’t recommend it. It is written for an audience working in a larger organization, not a small business. For example it says, “You can’t easily find an organization right now that doesn’t have at least one data warehousing initiative underway, on the drawing board, or in production. Everyone wants to consume data - which leads directly to the need for a data warehouse!”  Meh.\n\nI don’t think data drives a lot of activity in a small business (But we are trying to change that, right?).\n\n## What Is a Data Warehouse?\n\nBefore I started reading up on it I thought of a data warehouse as a sort of central core, like a nucleus of a cell. It’s more like a Costco. A Costco . . . for data. If you ask 100 consultants to, “Define a data warehouse in 20 words or less.” 95 of them will drop jargon like, subject-oriented, time-variant, & read-only. The other five are MBA’s that will talk about “improving corporate data driven decision making through timely access to information.\n\nA data warehouse is a home for high value data. This is high quality, refined information that has gone through a 25 point quality inspection and an upsell for a warranty you don’t really need.\n\n## What data should you stock?\n\nA data warehouse is a retail store. But this store has shelves stocked with data. Not raw data. Not partially processes data. This data is clean, refined, packaged and marketed for use. It’s helpful to think of data as having three major categories:\n\n- Run the business (raw) data: customer orders, manage finances, this is raw material.\n- Integrate the business (intermediate) data: a master list of customers, or other tools built to improve the quality and sync two or more corporate apps\n- Monitor the business (retail) data: Used for reporting and decision supports, like a financial dashboard. Data is clean to enable users to understand progress and evaluate cause and effect relationships.\n\nData assets are made of raw material (run the business data) to produce higher quality data products to integrate and monitor the business.\n\n## How to manufacture data assets?\n\nData warehousing is the coordinated, architected, and periodic copying of data from various sources, both inside and outside the enterprise, into an environment optimized for analytical and informational processing. It generally follows these five steps:\n\n- Select a focus area for tracking and reporting.\n- Identify a group of business users as subject matter experts.\n- List the different types of information that can enable them to use the data warehouse.\n- Identify where to get this information.\n- The data warehouse team creates extraction programs to collect the data, ETL (extract, transform, load).\n\n## First Steps?\n\nThis is where the official for Dummies book really falls apart. It’s good reference material but doesn’t offer anything upfront to help you get started. The first major decision you are going to need to make is where are you going to build your data warehouse? The three leading options are:\n\n- AWS\n- Google Cloud\n- Microsoft Azure\n\nBut you have options of using other platforms that work with the big three. Qubole is one. In my data warehousing for dummies pdf, I’ll help you take this first step as well as those that follow."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"April 15, 2018","title":"Out of Small Things","expertise":"My Journey","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nPerhaps you don’t consider yourself all that useful; perhaps you don’t consider yourself a blessing in somebody’s life.\n","hero_alt":"Out of Small Things","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#383838","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/dc8460dd2eecfb7b8a7676be4bf3bfde/87706/my_journey_.png","srcSet":"/static/dc8460dd2eecfb7b8a7676be4bf3bfde/f80f8/my_journey_.png 320w,\n/static/dc8460dd2eecfb7b8a7676be4bf3bfde/9a63f/my_journey_.png 640w,\n/static/dc8460dd2eecfb7b8a7676be4bf3bfde/87706/my_journey_.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/dc8460dd2eecfb7b8a7676be4bf3bfde/c0bcc/my_journey_.webp 320w,\n/static/dc8460dd2eecfb7b8a7676be4bf3bfde/17574/my_journey_.webp 640w,\n/static/dc8460dd2eecfb7b8a7676be4bf3bfde/71d4d/my_journey_.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"3df89e78-e341-5e96-9d0c-98b631f48978","fields":{"slug":"my_journey/out-of-small-things"},"parent":{"id":"820720f8-8f9f-5ca0-ae9e-6c2449aa5249","name":"out-of-small-things","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:38:52.463Z"},"body":"Perhaps you don’t consider yourself all that useful; perhaps you don’t consider yourself a blessing in somebody’s life.

I was reading for big data solutions for small business and it came up short. It boasted a clearly tech oriented author, with bonafides from Facebook’s own data lake. And offers insight into how LinkedIn, Twitter, & Ebay got started with big data. What isn’t clear is if Qubole's strategy is to overwhelm and scare potential customers into just giving up and calling the “expert” for help with big data solutions. I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt and say they are clearly reaching for a tech audience. When I finished it, I had two main takeaways:\n\n- The title of the book should have been, “How to Invest In Your Data.”\n- I need to build a data warehouse before I can build a data lake.\n\nI want to build a small business data lake. That would be fun. What does that mean? To start I want to connect to the APIs of the various social networks I am on and take my social media marketing to the next level. I’ve done that on a smaller scale and I learned that there are some insights you just can’t get any other way, even if you hire a full time social media manager. There is also the Google Analytics on my blog, I know there is more I can be doing with the data Google Analytics gives me. You can get lost in bells and whistles; to prioritize big data solutions for small business, I'd start with a data warehouse.  \n\nProbably not the best time to announce I am working on that with all that is happening with Facebook.\n\nOh. well.\n\nFor a small business, a blogger (like myself), or a starving artist social media offers the highest leverage to get your message out there. But it is really noisy. It’s also your best avenue to finding potential customers, but it is really noisy. But it's cheap, which is why it's so noisy. I think you can spend a lot of time wading through the noise on social media. I’m betting that my investment in a data warehouse/lake will help me get past the noise.\n\nWhich brings me back to the first takeaway, the title should have been, \"How To Invest In Your Data.\" That is how an owner thinks about big data solutions for small business: \"I know I should invest in data\", she says,  \"I just don't know where to start.\" \n\nI've been steeped in that grass roots approach thinking because I grew up in a small business, a New York Deli. (And yes, above is a pic of my family in the Deli.) I never watched Saturday morning cartoons growing up because we spent Saturdays at the Deli. It was my second home.\n\n## BIG DATA Solutions for Small Business.\n\nSo . .. if you (1) have something to offer, (2) want to market on social media, and (3) believe Google Analytics and data can help you be more effective then you should sign up for my new BETA Course: How to Invest in YOUR Data and get my Free Data Warehousing for Dummies PDF."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"March 18, 2018","title":"“all things shall work together for your good.”","expertise":"My Journey","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nThough the righteous fall seven times, they rise again.\n","hero_alt":"“all things shall work together for your good.”","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#687888","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/ce35ca7e25e65e5e4a15d11b7bf48d9c/87706/my_journey_7.png","srcSet":"/static/ce35ca7e25e65e5e4a15d11b7bf48d9c/f80f8/my_journey_7.png 320w,\n/static/ce35ca7e25e65e5e4a15d11b7bf48d9c/9a63f/my_journey_7.png 640w,\n/static/ce35ca7e25e65e5e4a15d11b7bf48d9c/87706/my_journey_7.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/ce35ca7e25e65e5e4a15d11b7bf48d9c/c0bcc/my_journey_7.webp 320w,\n/static/ce35ca7e25e65e5e4a15d11b7bf48d9c/17574/my_journey_7.webp 640w,\n/static/ce35ca7e25e65e5e4a15d11b7bf48d9c/71d4d/my_journey_7.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"98e1e3e0-40f0-5fde-8ca7-728c7623385f","fields":{"slug":"my_journey/rise-again"},"parent":{"id":"bda6416c-d5b8-5135-82e6-2256dc7c6e9c","name":"rise-again","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:38:52.477Z"},"body":"The fires in your life can threaten, frighten and sometimes burn.

That person with the perfect elevator pitch. That person who knows how to work a room. That person who keeps winning friends and influencing people. That that person who never eats alone. That person who's the quintessential networker. Don't you just hate them? Maybe not outright, but did you know networking skills have more to do with career progression than any other skill? Eighty percent of job openings are never publicly advertised: so maybe you just hate that somehow networking and making connections is SO easy to them and every time you try it feels sleazy.\n\nDo you feel networking is sleazy, slimy, and scammy? You are not alone. One study showed that thinking about networking subconsciously invoked a preoccupation with hygiene and grooming. Translation: networking makes us feel dirty. It’s easier to be disgusted by networking than to learn how to do it right — a classic pre-emptive defense mechanism. Unfortunately, the dismissive pleasure is short-lived. While you cry scam other people are getting ahead — ethically and rapidly.\n\nThe tricky part is keeping in touch with your network of colleagues and clients in a genuine way, so you don’t come off as self-serving. How do you maintain your connections over the long haul so that you can call when you need help (e.g., a job reference or a professional favor)?\n\nKeep reading, in the next six minutes you will find out what the experts have said than can make you a better networker.\n\n\n## The Difference Between Important & Urgent\n\nWhen you cry with those that mourn you get the benefit of hindsight. Let their hindsight be your foresight. Read these examples to see if there isn’t a reflection of yourself in between the lines.\n\n”I regret not taking advantage of the multiple networking events that occur due to the type of business my company is in. I could have made a ton of networking contacts that could have facilitated career advancement.” - Sean\n\n“After ~11 years, I find myself in role largely dictated by the first position I took out of college…. I’ve looked into other positions but found a reverse grass-is-greener problem — everything else seems boring or unimportant. My skills outside of my career are varied and vibrant, always expanding, but something about the daily grind has ground me down.” - Jeff\n\n“I wish that 4 years ago when I realized I wanted to make a career change and go into psychology, I hadn’t been deterred by the application process. I could be partially through my graduate degree by now, rather than trying to figure out how I’m going to change careers, get married, and start a family. I balked because I didn’t know who to get recommendations from.” - Erin\n\n“Taking two full years to realize that being a “self-starter” wasn’t just a trait you were born with – it’s something that’s cultivated, aggressively…I took the “appropriate” career path, but sat back waiting for a job to come to me.” - Nita\n\n“I wish I would have started networking and talking to people earlier. I had always assumed that accomplishments were only worth it if you did it completely alone, but every successful person around me has a large network of people that has helped them to get there. I don’t have to do everything myself; there’s no shame in getting other people to help, especially at the stuff I’m not good at.” - Andrea\n\n“I wish I had started early when it came to networking to find a job/make contacts while I was an undergrad…. I felt a little betrayed by my schools career development office – but have realized that I am the only person that is 100% looking out for me and my career.” - Matt\n\nWhat you’re seeing is the difference between what’s IMPORTANT and what’s URGENT. It’s always urgent to respond to that email, or to watch that TV show, or to do any of the 50 things we’re confronted with each day.\n\nBut doing what’s important is difficult. Cultivating a network, discovering what we love, really connecting with family — these are things that are more important than any email. Yet we don’t do them because we will ‘get to it later”.\n\nWe can put off what’s important but not urgent for another day, then another and another. Pretty soon, 10 years have gone by and we’re in a similar job as yesterday. Or we’ve hopped from job to job, never really knowing what you want, how to find it, and how to feel connected to work you love. Some of us are even making 6 figures, but still not where we want to be.\n\n## You Can Do More Than Regret\nIt’s far more powerful to spend a week trying to meet with one person than a week trying to go to random networking events. In this case, “less is more” is true — it’s far more effective to focus and meet interesting, relevant people.\n\nTop performers build their network BEFORE they need it. That’s how they can get laid off on a Monday and have a better job lined up by Friday. Read that sentence again, please — it means that top performers are comfortable meeting people and cultivating relationships with no specific purpose. In fact, the “reason” is almost always to help the other person!​\n\n## The First Steps Of Networking\n\nAs humans it is very hard to reach out to people we do not know. Especially people we know . . . of, but that we don’t know well. Just remember, we all start as strangers. I’ve covered this important step in this LinkedIn Article. The bread and butter of networking is making introductions. It’s important to learn how to do it right.\n\nTo use a baseball analogy reaching out and getting introduced is like running. You will not get on base if you don’t run. Informational Interviews are first base. We’ve all heard about “informational interviews” but few of us do it. We are all swinging for a double, trying to land a job interview with a cold resume on a hot job listing.What is an informational interview? How does it work? And how can you use subtle techniques to make an informational interview help you — and more importantly, the other person — even if you have seemingly little to offer?\n\nFirst, an informational interview is an opportunity to meet someone you’re curious about and learn from them. Maybe you’re curious about their role. Maybe you’re curious about their company’s work culture. An informational interview allows you to find out.\n\nSecond, THIS IS NOT WEIRD. What’s weird is responding to a job listing with the written version of a cold call and waiting around for them to call you. Really?\nReally. Informational interviews are powerful, yet because they seem “weird,” people don’t do them. Go ahead thinking they’re weird.\n\nNext, people do not want to meet with idiots, which includes people who…\n\nAsk worthless questions\nRamble\nOnly talk about themselves\nPeople WANT to meet with smart people. That means you, if you send a great email, have incisive questions, and are interesting. Let’s talk about what makes a great informational interview.\n\nReach out through a warm contact. If you don’t have one, find one. The info is out there: Facebook, Twitter, blogs, the “Acknowledgements” page of their book, LinkedIn does a lot of this for you.\n\nExplain any similarities you have. An alum reaches out who seems genuine? Who wouldn’t take a call or, if convenient, a coffee meeting. Maybe you grew up in the same town, or or are in the same LinkedIn Group.Reach out with a BRIEF, CONCISE EMAIL.\n\nAsk insightful questions. GOOD: I noticed you did XYZ. It’s interesting because Very-Important-Person took a different approach and did ABC. What was your thinking? BAD: I’m so unhappy at my job. What should I do with my life? Ugh. Get a bowl of soup and a therapist. That’s not the kind of question you ask at an informational interview. Here is another great question, what can I do to help / support your business?\n\nAsk questions for 90% of the informational interview, interjecting insightful comments once in a while, show you have done your homework. In the last 10%, mention what you are working on and ask for advice.\n\nNever outright ask for a job, which you never, ever do in an informational interview. Always give an “out”.\n\nNOTE: You don’t have to be socially smooth. Sometimes, awkward can be endearing! Not everyone is Rico Suave. But the very best show a remarkable level of preparation, which anyone can do — but few actually do.\n\nMany people stand out among the tens of thousands of others who leave comments/emails/tweets. Not only do the very best top performers have an uncanny ability to reach extremely busy people, but they can turn a one-time meeting into a long-term relationship. And over time, that is worth more than almost any technical skill or amount of experience.\n\n## To Do Today\n\nFollow these steps:\n\nBrainstorm list of 10 people you’d like to connect with. Start with these people: People who have a job title you’re interested in learning more about. People who work at companies you’re interested in potentially working at. And people who are doing interesting things you want to learn more about (e.g., you read about them in a magazine/blog post).\n\nGet their email address. If you can’t find this you fail at life. But you read this site so I suspect you’re cool. Use these scripts below for inspiration, or just use them.\n\n## How To Set up Your Informational Interviews\nAn informational interview is an opportunity to meet someone who works in a position or industry you’d like to work in, where you can ask them questions about their job and get the inside scoop.\n\nNever, ever directly ask for a job in an informational interview. That’s a big no-no. You can turn an informational interview into a potential job opportunity, but only if you approach it wisely. Here’s the first step of that process: The email introduction for an informational interview.\n\nBy the way, the best place to get informational interviews is via your alumni association.

We are the eyes, hands, head, feet, and other members of the body of Christ.”Ask your Heavenly Father to show you those around you who need your help and to inspire you on how to best serve them.

I take issue with this first quote:\n\n\"Open individuals have an affinity for liberal, progressive, left-wing political views, whereas closed individuals prefer conservative, traditional, right-wing views.\" (McCrae, 1996).\n\nThat is hard for me accept. I like Applebee's. And yeah, I saw David's wiener before I appreciated his abs. So, no I don't want to eat at Chez-anything but does that mean I can't appreciate a \"global community .... welcoming people from every discipline and culture who ... seek a deeper understanding of the world, and [who] hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all.\" (Ted, 2008)\n\nI love TED. And **AND** I know a lot of conservatives who do too. As a matter of fact, a very right wing conservative shared this video with me. So? What about that? Well, as hard as it is to accept the \"closed\" label, I choose to (1) accept it's a real perception and (2) keep an open mind and awareness about that.\n\n## Take the red pill, stay in Wonderland, and I’ll show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.\n\nI love how he ties in the Matrix. First, I just love that movie. Second, he challenges this self-professed liberal audience to make a choice: stay in their blue liberal moral matrix or, swallow the red (republican) pill. I love how he uses the colors to tie politics in with the movie. But in this case the red pill is an invitation to think more . . . conservative. He is simultaneously linking and juxtaposing ideas. Very creative.\n\n## The 5 Foundations of Morality\n\nThis is the core of the video. His research identifies how these five channels of morality play out in liberals and conservatives:\n\n- Harm / Care\n- Fairness / Reciprocity\n- InGroup / Loyalty / Tribes\n- Authority / Respect\n- Purity / Sanctity\n\nIf you don’t already know where you stand, you can take the survey here, [www.YourMorals.org](http://www.yourmorals.org/). Liberals put a higher value on Harm/Fairness. Conservatives put slightly less value on Harm/Fairness but, they put equal weight into all five areas: harm, fairness, InGroup, Authority, and Purity. Liberals discount these last three significantly compared to conservatives. You could say that liberals have a two-channel morality while conservatives have a five-channel.\n\nIn our current context loyalty and tribalism gets a bad rap. I really appreciate the value he illustrates that comes from our ability to form groups and sub-groups.\n\nThe great conservative insight is that order is precious and it is really easy to lose.\n\n## Can you handle the truth?\n\nLiberals and conservatives both have something to contribute. According to Jonathan Hait, they form a balance on change VS stability. Yin & Yang don't hate each other. Once we understand this, then the path is open to leave our moral matrix.\n\n> If you want the truth to stand clear before you. Never be for or against. The struggle between \"for\" and \"against\" is the mind's worst disease. ~ Sent-ts'an 700 CE\n\nWith that quote in mind, I’d really like to hear what you think. According to Jonathan Hait, liberals and conservatives form a balance on change VS stability. Do you agree? I don’t."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"March 5, 2018","title":"How can two truths exist at the same time if they conflict?","expertise":"My Journey","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nThe saying goes: there are three truths: your truth, my truth, and the actual truth.\nMeh.\n","hero_alt":"How can two truths exist at the same time if they conflict?","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#0878c8","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e051515bcf1bea51497df16a64cb08b3/87706/my_journey_1.png","srcSet":"/static/e051515bcf1bea51497df16a64cb08b3/f80f8/my_journey_1.png 320w,\n/static/e051515bcf1bea51497df16a64cb08b3/9a63f/my_journey_1.png 640w,\n/static/e051515bcf1bea51497df16a64cb08b3/87706/my_journey_1.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e051515bcf1bea51497df16a64cb08b3/c0bcc/my_journey_1.webp 320w,\n/static/e051515bcf1bea51497df16a64cb08b3/17574/my_journey_1.webp 640w,\n/static/e051515bcf1bea51497df16a64cb08b3/71d4d/my_journey_1.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"c92a3ffc-8237-599f-bcc8-74a1a68efa26","fields":{"slug":"my_journey/conflicting-truth"},"parent":{"id":"6dc21d9e-12c0-57ef-8c9a-13da793462d9","name":"conflicting-truth","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:38:52.464Z"},"body":"Truth is a story that we tell to give context to facts. As a story it is open to interpretation.\n\nI rediscovered this phrase the other day, “my truth”. Do people still say that? When I first heard it used, it was a way to enable sharing deeply held beliefs in a way that acknowledged and respected the deeply held beliefs of others. The phrase generally meant what is true for me based on my experience and understanding. It is valid and meaningful, but only for that person or for people who share that experience.\n\nNow it seems to have become overused. The emphasis used to be on ‘my’. The emphasis seems to have migrated to ‘truth’ with the ‘my’ serving as an essentially silent placeholder to stifle any challenge or debate. You can’t label an opinion as ‘truth’ by putting a ‘my’ in front of it. The saying goes: there are three truths: your truth, my truth, and the actual truth.\n\nMeh.\n\nNo. There are two. There is objective truth. These are what we call facts. Then there is subjective truth that is based on experience, context or opinion. The later has been substantiated, but is not objectively true in all situations. Objective truth is something that is true regardless of personal experience or opinion.\n\nFacts have limited use. One is not more desirable than the other. It is only when we combine facts with experience or give them context that we get information that we can use: knowledge. That usually looks like a story. So while truth may be based on facts and real experiences those experience evolve. Context changes. Stories are inherently human. They share our imperfection.

Some monarch butterfly populations migrate 3,000 miles (4,800 km) each year to climes better suited for their survival. Leatherback turtles travel across the Pacific Ocean from Indonesia to the coasts of California. Humpback whales swim from the cold waters of the North and South Poles toward the equator and back. Perhaps even more incredibly, the arctic tern flies from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica and back every year, some 60,000 miles (97,000 km).\n\nWhen scientists study this fascinating behavior, they ask questions such as “How do they know where to go?” and “How does each successive generation learn this behavior?”\n\nWhen I read of this powerful instinct in animals, I can’t help but wonder, “Is it possible that human beings have a similar yearning—an inner guidance system, if you will—that draws them to their heavenly home?”\n\nI believe that every man, woman, and child has felt the call of heaven at some point in his or her life.

His justification, such criticism makes healthy discourse impossible.\n\nThat is an odd defense. The definition of healthy discourse is the ability to speak openly, even critically.\n\nContrast this with Spencer W Kimball, discussing his duty as a church leader to admonish others:\n\n> In writing about sin and repentance, no intent is implied that [I] or any of those quoted, except the Lord himself, is without fault. But we would not have much motivation to righteousness if all speakers and writers postponed discussing and warning until they themselves were perfected!\n\nIt's a juvenile belief that in order to have meaningful communication you cannot criticize. It is the antithesis of meaningful communication. In his seminal book, How to Win Friends And Influence People, Dale Carnegie offers this first principle, “Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.” Sounds like Senator Paul, doesn't it? Only if you stick to headlines. The ideal Carnegie goes on to teach is to be kind, thoughtful, and considerate of others. Show respect to get respect. This principle encourages empathy when talking to other people.\n\nThe adage Senator Paul used struck a chord for me: \"Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.\" It's familiar. A less common but accurate meaning is: One who isn't open to criticism should not criticize. Senator Paul's takeaway: don't throw stones. President Kimball's takeaway: don't live in a glass house. Be open to criticism, or rather be mindful of your own imperfection.\n\nI'd rather have Kimball on my team. I'd rather have someone who is mindful of their own faults while striving to better all of us. Throw stones . . . gently."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"December 17, 2017","title":"Do You Work Too Hard?","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nHow do I deal with one thing after another blowing up in my face?\n","hero_alt":"Do You Work Too Hard?","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#486878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/2102a2d35b5e203a5895fd9918d477e2/6247c/business_7.png","srcSet":"/static/2102a2d35b5e203a5895fd9918d477e2/0c964/business_7.png 300w,\n/static/2102a2d35b5e203a5895fd9918d477e2/2bdcf/business_7.png 600w,\n/static/2102a2d35b5e203a5895fd9918d477e2/6247c/business_7.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/2102a2d35b5e203a5895fd9918d477e2/091a1/business_7.webp 300w,\n/static/2102a2d35b5e203a5895fd9918d477e2/763bf/business_7.webp 600w,\n/static/2102a2d35b5e203a5895fd9918d477e2/d7336/business_7.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":627}}}},"id":"fd049246-63a5-50e2-9147-19ffd9400ed4","fields":{"slug":"ai_strategy/gtd"},"parent":{"id":"68395896-3a7b-5a31-a15b-0aaebca06264","name":"gtd","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:25:48.406Z"},"body":"Do you get in early? Stay late? Eat lunch at your desk? Check email from bed? Do you take a lunch only when you’re drowning and just need to get out of the office? Is a burger, fries and a shake a reward for a grueling morning? Have you ever said, “I don’t want to live like this. This isn’t me.\"\n \nDo you have more than you can reasonably fit on your plate? Do you basically handle whatever falls off? But only if it explodes? If you have ever asked,\n\n> How do I deal with one thing after another blowing up in my face?\n\nI need . . . something . . . because I am drowning. Wave after wave of work is knocking me down and the tide is coming in.\n\nI’ve been there too.\n\nOver a quarter of a professional’s working day is spent emailing. 28% is spent emailing and email is open the rest of the day in case something potentially explosive comes through:\n\n- A short reply from the boss, asking about that deliverable\n- An unhappy client\n- Last week’s fire rearing its head, creating this week’s emergency\n\nA study of employees at Cisco revealed that failing to respond to an email can lead to a swift breakdown in trust. Are you sitting on an unexploded time bomb?\n\n## The research: Major source of work related stress is the pull for timely response to emails.\n\nIs email killing you? That might read like hyperbole; read on and decide for yourself. A study of British civil servants found that the rank and file employees were at greater health risk than higher ranking administrators. Chronic stress was the culprit. These employees were accountable for outcomes where they had little authority, influence or control. Negative outcomes appeared, as if at random, outside of their control and influence. The result, chronic stress.\n\nOften the sources of stress are small and varied, but chronic stress is linked to six of the leading causes of death, a slow death by a thousand papercuts. It’s not a huge leap to see that many of those small and varied stressors are coming from your inbox.\n\nHow does our work culture respond to this threat? Researchers have coined the term [telepressure](http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/11/24/the-downside-to-speedy-email-responses-work-stress) to describe the urge to respond immediately to email. I guess you can’t cure it ‘til you name it first. This urge includes thinking about emails that need to be written. As a result, says Larissa K. Barber, an assistant professor of psychology at Northern Illinois University, “You have trouble cognitively letting it go.”\n\nI've been there. The research is helpful. But it only confirms I'm not the only one that struggles with email, but that is not a solution. Managing email is a significant part of work. For my own sanity I went looking for a process to get my inbox under control because there had to be an easier way.\n\n## Getting Things Done.\n\nHave you heard of David Allen’s Getting Things Done? GTD for short. I’ve never read his book because my first exposure to his material was an MP3 download of the [GTD LIVE Two Day Seminar](https://store.gettingthingsdone.com/GTD-Live-p/20332.htm). David Allen offers an [introductory GTD course thru LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-things-done). It’s an introduction to the theory and general practices. It’s not bad. But if you want to really master the skill, it will only get you started. You will need something else to get into the details and best practices. If $99 and two days is too much, an alternative is this [Inbox Zero course from Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/google_gmail). I like it because it is highly specific, actionable, and it’s video instruction. This course wasn’t around when I was figuring this stuff out, but this is exactly what I did in my gmail.\n\nThe GTD LIVE Two Day Seminar is fantastic! Skip the book. I highly recommend this seminar. At $99 it is pricy but, [I have listened to it again and again](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oBqOEtTA-lm9k0FMuCEiVk57HK1Co2ZCxyHa9YjzsGc/edit?usp=sharing). As David Allen says, the process is iterative. It isn't all or nothing. You can apply parts of it. You can learn, apply, and grow. Then repeat. I've taken [a lot of notes]((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oBqOEtTA-lm9k0FMuCEiVk57HK1Co2ZCxyHa9YjzsGc/edit?usp=sharing)).\n\n## The Two Minute Rule\n\nOne of the biggest takeaways from David Allen is the two minute rule. Do anything that takes less than two minutes right away the first time it is in your face. It’s surprising how many things you put off that can get done in two minutes or less. For example, wash your dishes immediately after you eat, toss the laundry in the washing machine, take out the garbage . . . invest in yourself . . . invest in your time.\n\nBuy the seminar. You have two minutes."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"December 12, 2017","title":"The Drip","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nthis post is intentionally disfigured in honor of Break the Internet.

It brings people together to celebrate the harvest, to look each other in the eye and share something magical.\n\n\n## What is Gratitude, really?\n\nGratitude is a virtue. Gratitude is a habit. It is the virtue that Job leaned on during challenging times in his life. Gratitude is a catalyst to all christlike attributes. A thankful heart is a parent of all virtues. Practicing gratitude allows you to experience more happiness, improve your mental health, and be more productive. It is a choice. It is not difficult. But it is easy not to do. You can choose to develop a habit of gratitude and gain the benefits. Or you can allow yourself to slip into negative thoughts, walking around muttering to yourself, “I hate my life.” Gratitude is a disposition. A way of life that stands independent of our current situation.\n\n\n## How does Gratitude Help You . . . At Work?\n\nThose who are happy experience 31% higher productivity, 37% higher sales, 3x greater creativity and 23% fewer fatigue symptoms. Happy people are also up to 10x more engaged, 40% more likely to receive a promotion, and 39% more likely to live to age 94.\n\n\nMaster this one skill and you become invincible! When something bad happens in your life, look for three great things in your life. If you can learn how to position your mind in gratitude, things cannot hold you down. It’s impossible to take a grateful person and beat them down! It’s like a superpower. You can become invincible just by being grateful. As you build this muscle of gratitude, you’ll begin to even feel grateful for the hard times. The hard times make you tough. The hard times tear you down, so you can build a stronger you!\n\n\n## Take Advantage of the 2-20 Rule.\n\nShouldy Thinking. There are two forms of “Shouldy thinking”. Shouldy is a play on words: it sounds like sh*tty and is at the core the first type. If gratitude develops happiness, then entitlement develops depression. Entitlement is when you believe something should (shouldy) be happening that isn’t. You are not owed anything. Step out of expectation into genuine appreciation & gratitude.\n\n\nThat is not to say that there are not real injustices in the world that should be remedied. But let me ask you, would you be better prepared to tackle these injustices with a clear positive mind, or a crippled negative mind? This isn’t about the world and what everyone else does, this is about your inner place.\n\n\nThe second form of shouldy thinking is (are?) automatic negative thoughts. Or ANTs. Like real ants these just creep up on you. And there are more than one.\n\n\nDid you know your brain is 2% of your body’s weight but consumes 20% of the calories you consume. This thanksgiving think about that. Seriously. One fifth, that is 400 calories, or a piece of pumpkin pie. What you eat affects what you think, that is the 2-20 rule.\n\n\nIt is a gratitude that heals the heart and expands the mind.\n\n\n## What do I have to be grateful for when my world is falling apart?\n\nWe can choose to limit our gratitude, based on the blessings we feel we lack. But those who set aside the bottle of bitterness and lift instead the goblet of gratitude can find a purifying drink of healing, peace, and understanding. It might sound contrary to the wisdom of the world to suggest that one who is burdened with sorrow should give thanks to God.\n\nIt is easy to be grateful for things when life seems to be going your way. But what do you do when what you wish for is far out of reach? It is difficult to develop a spirit of gratitude if our thankfulness is proportional to the number of blessings we can count. Instead of being thankful for your circumstances, focus on being thankful in your circumstances.\n\nIn times of distress expressing gratitude does not require you to also be pleased with your circumstance. It does not stop you from looking beyond present-day challenges and seeing through eyes of faith what can be. This is not a gratitude of the lips but of the soul. It is a gratitude that heals the heart and expands the mind.\n\n## Develop Gratitude with this ONE simple tool. And it’s FREE!\n\nWrite down three new things that make you happy. Each day, see if you can rewire your brain’s for greater optimism and benefit from a boost of happiness. By actively finding ways to practice gratitude, joy and social connection, your brain will retain a pattern of scanning the world for the positive first rather than the negative. You can also use journaling time by recognizing negative thoughts (ANTs) and challenging their validity. Recognizing them for what they are is 70% of the battle.\n\nThere are some common results you will experience by doing this simple gratitude journal. Many experience feeling calm, re-energized, and more ready to tackle the day; the ability to see things more clearly, feeling grounded, seeing opportunities rather than limitations; and the joy of spreading positivity to others.​\n\n## References & Additional Reading:\n\nI straight up stole most of this blog from different sources that are greater than I.

That sparked some curiosity this week and I decided to write a reboot of a post I published . . . . a long time ago. #preIPHONE \n\nThe Book of Mormon Musical is about a Mormon missionary called to serve in Uganda. Of course he doesn't know Uganda is in Africa because he is a religious character in American media. In America people of faith are portrayed as one of two stereotypes: (1) uneducated & naive, or (2) bat-shit crazy. In Africa he is forced to confront the harsh realities of life. This experience reveals his religious dogma as insufficient at best.\n\nThe premise is that a faith based life is too simple and naive to offer real help for the complex realities of life.​\n\nCuriosity piqued.

Might as well get a PhD while I'm at it.\n\nStill I've been shopping for a Master's degree. A lot of companies offer some type of leadership development / mentoring. If you combined that with Corsera work I'm sure I could match the curriculum of most MBA programs. I could create a more tailored program that would be preferable. Any program would have to include some type of social networking component. That is obviously not the same as a master's. But.\n\nLet's look at the value gap between the two. Let's assume simple numbers. I make 50k and by getting a masters I expect to increase my earnings to 100k. Even if I finance my education, paying three times as much over time, It is a 90k investment over several years with a return of an additional 2.1 million in earnings over the course of my working life. So. No brainer right?\n\nWell. No. I know plenty of MBAs starting around 60k. If you invest the same 90k in education for and additional 10k a year then you will break even for ten years to pocket an additional 234k over your working life. Valuing the additional time and effort, I don't think it is worth it.\n\nWith Corsera there is considerably less risk. It's $50 a month (about $1800 for three years). Corsera offers less risk, but at a cost. The market values an MBA more than comparable course work. So all things equal an MBA candidate should win out over someone who completed coursework on Corsera.\n\nShould. But.\n\nThere is the argument that schools don't add value to employees. They are tools we use to signal employers. So if you have enough drive does it matter? I think it does. School will open doors.\n\nThere is also the marginal utility of additional earnings. Once you get over 76k the marginal utility of a dollar starts tapering off. Basically, you will have nicer stuff but you will not be any happier. More people are starting to realize that. Big house nice car is a dated value.\n\nMy question. Is an MBA 16 times better than online coursework? It costs 16 times as much. No doubt it is better, but 16 times better?"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"November 13, 2017","title":"Four Aspects of Leadership You Need To Know About","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nhe more I read the more I feel I need to read.

I read a lot in this space. The more I read the more I feel I need to read. It can be discouraging. It is easier for you to digest if you break it down into chunks. Here are four to start: building relationships, business acumen, self awareness, & organizational strategy.\n\n**Building Relationships.** Do you want to be my friend? Sometimes that is all it takes. My kids do it all the time. Building leadership starts with positive and effective relationships. This is a core competency.\n\n**Business Acumen.** You need to be able to do something, attain goals with minimum guidance. Otherwise you are just hanging out. This includes the competencies of teamwork, performance & motivation. Although it also encompasses technical skills, managing work, and industry knowledge.\n\n**Self Awareness.** Self awareness is the bud that flowers into leadership. If you think of these as stages then this is where a top performer starts to become a leader. That is why a lot of training starts here. Self awareness includes the competences of vision & values, sustainability, resilience, and emotional intelligence.\n\n**Organizational strategy.** The ability to set the vision and direction for the long term success of the organization. Its comprised of the following competencies: political acumen, awareness. change, culture.\n\n## 12 Core Competencies of Leadership\n- Building Relationships\n- Teamwork\n- Performance\n- Motivation\n- Vision & Values\n- Sustainability\n- Resilience\n- Emotional intelligence\n- Political Acumen\n- Awareness\n- Change\n- Culture\n\nIt's impossible to tackle all of them at once. That is the point of chunking it down. Pick one. Make a four to six week plan to focus on a skill in your chosen competency. Work to actively change your behaviors and habits. Habits drive change. It takes 4 to 6 weeks groove the behavioral and neurological pathways of the new habit you want to create. In a year to a year and a half you can make meaningful progress in each of the 12 competencies.\n\n## Some additional tips for developing leadership.\n\nCreate a masterminds group with professional peers. Focus: What is working? What needs improvement? Share challenges and successes. Support each other with suggestions, encouragement, ideas for improvement. Network to create mutually beneficial opportunities.\n\nAttend leadership development programs. Some ideas on where to look for programs: at work, local universities, non-profits, LinkedIn Learning, Coursera.\n\nForm a leadership development group. Read a book or take a course and come together to discuss implementing the changes.\n\n## Data Driven Leadership\n\nWhy talk about leadership on a blog about data? We have not talked about data or decision making. I don't have a lot of time to write. I debated including leadership as a thread of this blog. I decided the topic merited inclusion.\n\nThese 12 competencies are inputs that go into decisions at an organizational level. To make the [best use of data a data driven organization]((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo7cTcM9JjvtRUoTarvDCaBCVqb8KFlZDDAg9z2TvdY/edit#heading=h.hxpjzhd42hw8)), a data savvy manager, needs an understanding of leadership theory. The theory informs a leader of the right questions to ask when mining data. I've taken some additional notes on these 12 competencies. I plan to flesh these out over time showing how they play a role in a [data driven organization]((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo7cTcM9JjvtRUoTarvDCaBCVqb8KFlZDDAg9z2TvdY/edit#heading=h.hxpjzhd42hw8)).

If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty. ~ Wilford Woodruff. President, LDS Church\n\nI used to think this meant that the the leaders of the church were infallible: incapable of making a mistake or being wrong.

The work and glory of God is the immortality and eternal life of man (and woman). What doesn't it mean? It isn't . . . to be right. It isn't to be above reproach. It isn't freedom from embarrassment.\n\nDid Joseph Smith doubt that he had been lead astray when he wrote, \"O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?\"\n\nProbably not. But if Joseph Smith could suffer torment, isolation, and martyrdom I think public embarrassment is within the scope.\n\n< Opinion > The Lord will not risk the immortality and eternal life of his sheep, but he will not protect us from feeling sheepish. < / Opinion >\n\n## President Gordon B. Hinckley grapples with the fallibility of LDS leadership.\n\nPresident Hinkley experienced it in a way few ever have or will. Elder Gordon B. Hinckley was called as a third Counselor to the First Presidency on July 23 1981, when President Spencer W. Kimball as well as his two counselors were unable to attend to all their duties. By 1984, Hinckley was the only publicly active member of the First Presidency. After Kimball's death, Ezra Taft Benson became President of the Church. Benson named Hinckley his first counselor and Thomas Monson his second. In the early 1990s, Benson developed serious health problems, removing him from public view. Hinckley and Monson carried out many of the duties of the First Presidency until Benson died in 1994. After Benson’s death, Howard W. Hunter became President and retained Hinckley and Monson as counselors in the First Presidency. Hunter died nine months later. At this point in 1995, Hinckley assumed the mantle of Prophet. Hinkley knew the limits of those called to the presidency better than most. His thoughts:\n\n>I have worked with the Presidents of the Church from President Heber J. Grant onward. … I have known [their] counselors, and I have known the Council of the Twelve during [these] years. All of these men have been human. They have had human traits and perhaps some human weaknesses. But over and above all of that, there has been in the life of every one of them an overpowering manifestation of the inspiration of God. Those who have been Presidents have been prophets in a very real way. I have intimately witnessed the spirit of revelation upon them. The Lord refined and polished each one, let him know discouragement and failure, let him experience illness and in some cases deep sorrow. All of this became part of a great refining process, and the effect of that process became beautifully evident in their lives. ~ Gordon B Hinckley, President, LDS Church\n\n## From the life of President Monson.\n\n2015 October Conference. President Monson is concluding his thoughts when his strength began to fail putting him at risk of a fall. Why doesn't someone help him? With the lights dimmed, very few can see the whole picture as the prophet concludes his remarks. Michelle Cope was there. Her story is a great example of how the Lord carries us at times. She gives the following account:\n\n>Most of you probably did not see what was happening behind President Monson at the end of his talk. I was on the floor, just a few rows from the very front of the Conference Center with a clear view of the scene. You might have noticed that President Monson really struggled to finish the last couple minutes of his talk and especially the last 30 seconds. I was afraid for him. I thought he might faint, pass out, or something worse.\n\n>And then, my heart melted when I saw behind President Monson was President Uchtdorf – on the edge of his seat, almost half-way standing up, with his arms stretched out, ready to catch the Prophet at any moment if he fell. You could see the worried expression on President Uchtdorf’s face as well as focused determination. He was on high alert and ready to catch him. As soon as President Monson said “Amen”, President Uchtdorf was immediately at his side and carried him back to his seat, safe and sound.~ Michelle Cope\n\nPresident Monson teaches us, both in word and example, when we are on the Lord’s errand, He promises, “I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”\n\nWhen your life is difficult, when affliction leaves you wobbling and short of breath, don’t worry if no one is by your side, because He has your back.\n\nHaving the answers is not the mark of faith. It is only by asking questions that we gain our own greater understanding.*** I find these stories from the lives of two presidents build my faith in the leadership of the church as well as in myself. It is on you to work out your own salvation. The Lord will not put our salvation at risk but, you might by holding an expectation of infallibility in our leaders.\n\n*** Answers are not necessarily included."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"October 18, 2017","title":"Job of a DataScientist: Separating Signal from Noise.

Signal represents valuable consistent relationships that we want to learn. Noise is the random correlations and stuff that will not occur again in the future. The combination of signal and noise takes on familiar patterns or shapes that we can use to build a model.\n\nModels can consider varying degrees of signal and noise. On end of the spectrum is the non-model which disregards signal & noise. Consider this common upsell question.\n\n“Would you like fries with that?” This approach requires no model. It disregards signal and noise, rigidly canvassing everyone regardless of who they are or what they ordered:\n\n“I’ll have a salad, hold the dressing. And a bottled water.”\n\n“Would you like fries with that?”\n\n“Carbs? Uh, no thank you.”\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum are flexible solutions that consider signal and noise. The predictions gathered are influenced by every piece of data, including outliers which can (and do) skew outcomes. These solutions can be more damaging than using no model at all. Such models lose predictive ability for new data because they are too tightly bound to their original training data. This is called overfitting.\n\nThis post is a continuation of my last post where I went over [what is the difference between machine learning and data science](/thoughts/whats-the-difference-between-business-intelligence-and-business-analytics). This post goes a step further to talk about how we use machine learning to separate signal from the noise. There are many machine learning algorithms. Think of them as tools in a tool box. Data scientists use these pre-built algorithms to tease models from their data sets.\n\nA handful of these tools are based on classical statistical methods which makes them easy to interpret. If the model is being used to aid a human to make decisions it’s a good idea to develop the model with these classical methods:\n\n- Linear regression\n- Logistic regression\n- K-means classification\n- K-nearest neighbors\n- Hierarchical clustering\n- Naive Bayes\n\nThere are more options If there is no human involvement in the decision process; think of Netflix making a recommendation, no one reviews the recommendation before you get it. If there is no human element or if there is a high tolerance for opaque black box methods there is an additional group of modern machine learning algorithms:\n\n- Random Forest\n- LASSO\n- Hidden Markov Models\n- Support Vector Regression\n- Artificial Neural Networks\n- Apriori Algorithms\n\nDiscussing each of these is outside the scope of this post. But if you are interested in learning more, make sure to subscribe to my email list for data savvy professionals and get a copy of “Bull Doze Thru Bull.”\n\n**Take away.** If you are evaluating a machine learning project a great question is to ask about the algorithms that were used. LASSO & Random Forest are as close to out of the box all purpose tools as you will find so they are quite common. The classical methods are a conservative choice. The modern machine learning methods are really black box solutions which means they probably tried all of them and went with the tool that performed the best in testing."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"October 5, 2017","title":"What is the difference between business intelligence and business analytics?","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nWhat’s the difference between business intelligence and machine learning?

In actuality the answer is, “well . . . sort of. Maybe. It’s more machine learning. At least some people think so.” The quick answer is that Business Intelligence is an evolving industry. If I get into it there is a variety of follow up questions that usually start: “What’s the difference between …”\n\nWhat’s the difference between business intelligence and machine learning? Even if you google these terms it’s hard to find a good definition. For sure you will find definitions, but not meaning and context for a never ending list of terms in a jargon rich field.\n\nQuoting a Google employee, “Everything at the company is driven by machine learning.” What does that mean exactly? Is that big data? What about data mining? How does that fit in? Is this all just fancy jargon for old school econometrics and statistics?\n\nIn the next 3 min i am going to take on the job of getting you up to speed on what all these terms mean in relation to each other. It isn’t enough to have a list of definitions, you need to understand context. That is what I will give you here. Context.\n\nWhat Business intelligence is . . . and isn’t.\nWhen you think about Business Intelligence you might confuse it for Business Analytics. Business Intelligence runs the business. Business Analytics changes the business. Intelligence directs process. Analytics directs strategy. Intelligence focuses understanding for today. Analytics focuses planning for tomorrow.\n\nBI is real time access to data. Reporting. BI identifies current problems, solutions, and enables informed decision making. Business Analytics explores data: statistical analysis, quantitative analysis, data mining, predictive modelling among other technologies and techniques to identify trends and make predictions. But the two areas are merging as evidenced by these headlines:\n\n- 5 Ways Machine Learning Can Make Your BI Better\n- Machine Learning: The Real Business Intelligence\n- Machine Learning: The Future of Business Intelligence.\n- Big Data & BI Trends 2017: Machine Learning, data lakes, and Hadoop Vs Spark\n- How Does  Machine Learning Relate to Business Analytics? What is it?\n\nI’ve heard machine learning described as the brains behind AI. Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives \"computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" I think of Machine Learning as a collection of pre-built algorithms for building models to predict future outcomes. Business analytics is about using those models on the execution side, putting insight into context and making things happen. In my last post I talked about the difference between data science and data savvy. Business analytics requires data savvy while machine learning is a component of data science.\n\n## What is Data Science?\n\nData Science deals with structured and unstructured data. In principle, everything that relates to data cleaning, preparation and analysis lies within the scope of Data Science. Data science is interdisciplinary requiring training in statistics, computer science, and industry. Solo practitioners with specialization in all three areas are rare so it is common to have data science teams: a data savvy manager, an econometrician, & a developer trained in machine learning.\n\n**Traditional Research.** If you know anything about analytics (or statistics) you are probably familiar with regression: “ordinary least squares”. If not I highly recommend reading the book, Freakonomics. Regression is a mathematical way of drawing a straight line that most closely fits a scatterplot of data.\n\nRegression is the basis for econometrics which is squarely found in the arena of traditional research. Traditional research blends classical statistics with industry knowledge. The emphasis of traditional econometrics is to use statistical tools to determine causal relationships in data. An econometrician wants to be able to tell why something is happening in the data. They want to tell a story about why you see correlations. And they do that using different variations of the regression technique.\n\n**Software development.** We all have apps that make our lives easier & more entertaining. A relative few are lucky enough to earn a living developing and/or supporting software, SaaS (Software as a Service). Traditional software development makes processes more efficient. Most of development exists around this. This field requires both Computer Science (coders) as well as industry knowledge. This space is marked by partnerships between clients and their SaaS providers. \n\nDevelopers will spend a lot of time and resources understanding their client's existing process to build solutions around industry best practices.\n\n**Machine Learning.** Which brings us back to machine learning, which is probably not as familiar as software development or traditional research. When a developer uses machine learning, what does that look like? It starts with a dataset. As is the case with traditional research the first step is to prepare the data for analysis. Data prep, munging or data wrangling, as it is called is the most time intensive step. The second step is to separate the data into two parts. Two thirds to 70% of the data is used for training the model. One third to 30% is saved for testing the model. A machine learning modeler has a variety of tools at their disposal to build a model of relationships based on the training data. The modeler will then make predictions about the test data based on this model. The more accurate the predictions, the better the model.\n\n## Summary\n\nAt this point you should have a clear idea of what data science is: a blending of machine learning, traditional research, and software development to create predictive models. To contrast BI focuses on dashboards and reporting for the here and now. BI focuses on process. DS focuses on strategy. Data science requires a variety of advanced skill sets which makes data science teams quite common (and full stack data scientists quite rare). Business analytics on the other hand requires data savvy: a survey level understanding of data science topics with the purpose of putting these models to good use by executing on business goals.\n\nAmong these topics a data savvy professional should be familiar with is an understanding of machine learning and the strengths and limitations of the more common algorithms used in machine learning.

Remember, large subsidizes small; In this Naked Economics Chapter 8 Summary i'll cover five contexts he identifies: The (1) analogy of a Christmas tree is an easy visual aid to understand why omnibus spending packages get passed. A counter intuitive context comes from George Stigler, who shows (2) businesses benefit from regulation. He provides a cautionary tale about (3) China’s historical protectionism. He shows how (4) the WTO and Fast Track Authority is used to curtail bad behavior. He concludes sharing (5) an anecdote that exposes our own hypocrisy in the role we play.\n\n## THE MOHAIR ADVANTAGE\n\nWe are talking about pork, you need to know what that is. The poster child for pork-barrel legislation is a 40 year subsidy paid out to mohair farmers to ensure the U.S. military supply of yarn to make uniforms. The subsidy was created in 1955. Five years later the military switched to synthetic fibers. The subsidy remained for the next 35 years until public outcry forced it to end in 1995. It made its way back into the budget in 2008.\n\n\n## NAKED ECONOMICS CHAPTER 8: ​ECONOMICS OF REGULATION\n\nWhy did the mohair subsidy come back? It’s asinine. The economics of regulation is a simple model (tool) to help you think about organized interest group politics. Gary Becker, an economist, says it pays to be small. All else equal, small, well organized groups are more successful in the political process. It is easier for the countless masses to pay a few extra cents in taxes to benefit a relative few. Those few are highly motivated to protect that benefit, whereas the general population is largely unaware. As a result, “the democratic process will always favor small, well organized groups at the expense of large diffuse groups (p. 147 of Naked Economics Chapter 8).” In the case of ethanol, a $7 billion tax subsidy is gifted to a small group of farmers, less than 2% of the population. Meanwhile, the cost is spread over the remaining 98%, putting ethanol somewhere below good oral hygiene on our list of concerns. To put that into context for you, this subsidy amounts to $2 a month for every American.\nIn countries where farming makes up a small fraction of the population, American and Europe, there are subsidies for agriculture. In countries where the farming population is relatively large, China and India, the subsides go the other way, forcing farmers to sell at below market prices. In both cases, the large group, largely unaware, subsidizes the smaller highly motivated group. In politics, the tail wags the dog.\n\n## OH CHRISTMAS TREE: MODELING THE POLITICAL RESPONSE TO ORGANIZED INTEREST.\n\nThe process that generated cash payments to mohair farmers is alive and well. This year during Utah’s GOP Convention, senate hopefuls took turns vowing that they would not sign omnibus spending bills. Which means very little in Iowa. The benefits from ethanol subsidies are debatable but it works wonders in Iowa campaigns. The ethanol subsidy puts money in the pockets of Iowa farmers it’s a key issue for them. These omnibus spending bills are like a christmas tree. Each legislator from the house and senate can hang an ornament or two. Each has their constituency to answer to and these spending initiatives go a long way to grease the wheels of those relationships.\n\n\n## DEATH BY 1,000 SUBSIDIES?\n\nIn practice each ornament is called an earmark. Earmarks direct federal money to local projects in the member’s district. \nEach ornament on the tree is insignificant, but taken together they are significant. \nOn principle, government should not be in the business of providing incentives for people to do things that would not otherwise make sense. \nThe Council for Citizens Against Government Waste identified [$6.8 Billion of pork legislation in the 2017 budget](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/07/19/pork-barrel-spending-on-the-rise-in-congress-watchdog-group-says/?noredirect=on)\n. If this was listed out as a line item on the 2017 budget, it would fall between water resources (7.5M) and recreational and sporting services(3.9M). \n \nPork spending cost my family $80 last year.  We spent $252 on Netflix and Hulu. We spent $7,300 on healthcare.\n\nWhere would you look to tighten up this budget?\n\n## BUSINESSES BENEFIT FROM REGULATION\n\nGeorge Stigler of the University of Chicago, 1982 nobel prize winner shows that firms and industries often benefit from regulation. They can create regulation to help themselves or hobble competitors. In illinois the state requires barbers and manicurists to be licensed, but not electricians. Why? Interest groups.\nOccupational licensure is a result of special interest groups desire to set up barriers to entry for other seeking to enter the occupation: “The best predictor of whether or not a professional is licensed in Illinois is the size and budget of its professional associations.” Take for example, teacher certification and the teacher’s union. The union is always strongly in favor of teacher certification that enforces rigorous testing and scrutiny for teachers. However, that same policy exempts existing teachers from needing to recertify. This is illogical at best, even disingenuous. If doing certain things is necessary in order to teach, then presumably anyone standing at the front of a classroom should have to do them. The real motive for the licensure is to create a barrier to entry in the teaching profession.  This is good for existing teachers but, not for the education market.\nCapitalism is a process of incessantly destroying the old. That may be good for the world; it’s bad for the businesses that make up the “old”. The legislative process helps those who help themselves. Groups under siege from competition can seek, trade protection, bailouts, tax considerations, patents, and other special treatment. There is a crucial distinction between using political process to build safety nets for those harmed by creative destruction and using the process to stop that creative destruction in the first place.\n\n## PROTECTIONISM: A CAUTIONARY EXAMPLE FROM CHINA\n\nFifteenth century China, 500 years ago, was a far more technologically advanced than the west. China had better science, farming, engineering and medicine. The chinese were using iron 1500 years before Europe (think middle ages). That’s 200 B.C. They were far ahead of the curve.\nWhere did the industrial revolution happen? Not China. Chinese elites valued stability over progress. They didn’t have the stomach for the wrenching societal changes that made the industrial revolution happen. They banned sea voyaging for trade. They effectively choked off the economic development and discovery that comes from trade.\n​\n## WTO AND FAST TRACK AUTHORITY\n\nWhen negotiating international trade deals the president can seek “fast track authority”. This limits congress's ability to ratify the agreement to a strict up or down vote.  The normal process that allows for amendments (and pork) which can exempt (and protect) certain industries. A trade deal with a few loopholes for every district defeats the purpose. The World Trade Organization uses the same process on the world stage. Each nation has domestic interest groups vying for protection and or benefits. The WTO makes free trade politically manageable by creating a standard that countries must abide by to join: open markets, eliminating subsidies, phasing out tariffs, etc. To have access to the markets of existing members each nation has to agree to the standard. Each of these tools exists as a counter balance to the power that special interests can invoke on politicians at the expense of the general public.\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"July 1, 2017","title":"Why Your Salary Will Always Be Below Average","expertise":"Artificial Intelligence","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nThere are two issues with this number.

Maybe you’ve tried the Payscale salary calculator? Is your take home pay below average? Chances are it is. Use the calculator below and find out.\n\nIt’s ok . . . i’ll wait.\n\nDid you check it out? Is that surprising? Before you start planning how to bring this up with your boss you might want to take a second look at that number. I'll explain.\n\n\n## Income follows a power law distribution.\n\nThere are two issues with this number. First you will run into trouble if you look for averages where there aren't any. Income follows a power law distribution.\n\nWhat’s that?\n\nIf you have heard of Pareto’s 80/20 rule, that is a power distribution. For income, 80% of the income is earned by 20% of people. Don’t take that literally. \n\nIf we plot out income you would see a small number of people earn a disproportionately larger amount of money relative to everyone else. \n\nIf you try to take the average of a set of incomes (any power distribution) your average will wildly misrepresent the truth. It's going to underestimate a small number of people, and overestimate the majority. The average makes it seem seem like higher incomes are more common than they are in actuality. Case and point:\n\nBill Gates walks into a bar and everyone inside becomes a millionaire . . .\n . . . on average.\n\nSo when you or someone else pulls up a report on glassdoor and circles the average salary, it is likely not telling the whole story.\n\nBut. You might ask, what if Bill Gates doesn’t walk into the bar? What if in this bar we only have locals who all work the same job. I like where your head's at. You might be onto something. But no, you’re not.\n\nIncome follows a power distribution even on a localized scale, it's just less noticeable. Let's look at SaaS Implementation Consultants in Provo, UT. The average is $50,800. But look at the range. The low is $39K and the high is $78K. There are a few highly paid individuals driving the average up but most consultants probably earn less than 50K. In full disclosure I don’t know. But the point is neither do you.\n\nThe average is not representative of this sample. Let alone the salaries that were not reported.\n\nImplementation consultant earn $50,800  in Provo, UT are on average. \n\nAverage is not the same as usual and customary.\n\nHere is the second issue. What do you think of when I say average? When we talk averages, most people assume it's a mean. Most people would agree that average and mean are synonymous. That is not the case. An average doesn't have to be a mean. You can google the definition: a number expressing the central or typical value in a set of data, in particular:\n\nthe mode, median, or mean. \n\nWhen you read about an average, you could be reading about one of three different measurements. It's easy to be mislead. The government reports median income. Median is the middle number: 50% earn above median, 50% below. But what if I want to know what salary is usual and customary? What do most people make? This is the mode. If you want to get a sense of where the long tail on the power law distribution falls, the mode would work best. It will tell you what the most common salary is. That could be useful.\n\nThe lesson:\nDon’t hang your hat on average salary. First, averages don’t fit the data very well. You can take the average, that doesn’t mean you should. Second, when you see an average take steps to learn what kind of average it is. Personally, I find the bookends, the high and low values of a range, to be more useful.\n\nDo you want to learn more? If you a SaaS professional that struggles with aligning your team & getting to the truth then you have come to the right place. Find out how to use averages, bookends, and other KIPs to make better use of your data so you can . . ."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"July 1, 2017","title":"How Great Leaders Inspire Action","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nYou might be leading a team, crafting the bullet points on your resume, making a recommendation on Facebook. \nWhat do you say to persuade others to take action?\nWhat do you say?\n","hero_alt":"How Great Leaders Inspire Action","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#080808","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/3a7934c71f47525023a3d0689378c9a6/6247c/start_with_why.png","srcSet":"/static/3a7934c71f47525023a3d0689378c9a6/0c964/start_with_why.png 300w,\n/static/3a7934c71f47525023a3d0689378c9a6/2bdcf/start_with_why.png 600w,\n/static/3a7934c71f47525023a3d0689378c9a6/6247c/start_with_why.png 1200w","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/3a7934c71f47525023a3d0689378c9a6/091a1/start_with_why.webp 300w,\n/static/3a7934c71f47525023a3d0689378c9a6/763bf/start_with_why.webp 600w,\n/static/3a7934c71f47525023a3d0689378c9a6/d7336/start_with_why.webp 1200w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px, 100vw"}]},"width":1200,"height":627}}}},"id":"bd0f434f-c72c-5e44-91fd-cb565ca6d53a","fields":{"slug":"ai_strategy/values-2017"},"parent":{"id":"20bae0b9-6233-5c93-bbce-56624cabf674","name":"values-2017","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:25:48.396Z"},"body":"Often I get a question that reveals a fundamental mistake we all make every day. This is my answer.\n\nIt gets asked a lot. Well, maybe?\n\nMaybe, it's just that to a hammer everything is a nail. This is my hammer.\n\nYou might be leading a team, crafting the bullet points on your resume, making a recommendation on Facebook. What do you say to persuade others to take action?\n\nWhat do you say?\n\nJamie Dimon puts it like this, \"Leadership is relentless storytelling. We all forget. We all need to be reminded of our purpose.\"\n\n\nSo, what's your story?\n\n## ​The Mistake That Is Costing You\n\nSee if you catch yourself doing this the next time you have to write a performance evaluation. Do you focus on what you did? Take a look at your resume. What is the focus? Is it on what you did? Think of the last good movie you saw or book you read. What can you tell me about it?\n\nAre you tempted to give away the plot? You (and just about everyone else) is focused too much on the what.\n\nYou need to start with Why. Simon Sinek wrote a whole book on why. But you can get away with just watching the TED talk.\n\n[![Start With Why](./media/content/start_with_why_video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4)\n\nAnyone (and everyone) can tell you what they do.\n\nSome can talk about how. This is 90% of what marketers will focus on: differentiating value proposition, proprietary process, secret sauce, or USP (unique selling proposition).\n\nVery few people will talk about Why, Purpose, Cause, Belief. Why do you get out of bed in the morning? Why should anyone care? People don't buy what you do they buy why you do it. And the what serves as the proof of what you believe.\n\nThe goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. It is not making money; that is a result. Start with Why, then follow it up with How and What.\n\n## How to Start with Why​\n\n​I bought Start With Why hoping to learn how to start with Why. It's a good read. I've read and re-read it. The book comes up short at the end where Sinek up sells a $100 course to help you find your why. I opted to figure it out on my own. It took a little over a year to nail down a repeatable process. But it was free! If you are interested in learning how I did it, keep reading.\n\nArticulating your Why is difficult. It's innately fuzzy. Your goal is to bring it into sharp focus. That might take some time. Just keep coming back to it.\n\nMy first attempts were heavily influenced by the Strengths Finder 2.0 Assessment. I highly recommend this assessment. It's free when you purchase the book, Strengths Finder 2.0. This is a great tool if you are looking for an objective measure of your innate strengths. Here is the catch, even as I explored my strengths I knew that strengths are not the same as purpose. This answers the question How, not Why. That is valuable, just not the final stop. Your strengths set you apart from the crowd, they are your USP, your secret sauce. So the exercise is worth taking the time to do.\n\nIt's ironic that the question Simon Sinek leaves unanswered in his TED talk is answered by another TED talk: How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes by Adam Leipzig.\n\n[![How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes](./media/content/life_purpose_video.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M)\n\nI'm sure you have heard of the idea of an elevator pitch. Adam goes through a series of questions so you can articulate yours in under five minutes: your own elevator pitch that starts with why. You can check out mine on my LinkedIn Profile. Or my Instagram Bio. Even the intro of my Facebook page.\n\n​But that is not going to be enough. It isn't going to weather the storm. And the storms will come. Believe that.\n\n## What's It All For?\n\n###### What's it all for? Tour bus, studio, and the fans, \n\n###### What's it all for? Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims,\n\n###### What's it all for? To feed my family and my friends,\n\n###### What's it all for? To change your world the best I can.\n\n###### [What's It All For](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEk_XPY1sSg), Bazaar Royal\n\n\nThe final piece came after I read Mark Manson's The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck. I think he is a terrific writer. He utilizes a strong voice (and language, consider yourself warned).\n\nI could not have come across his book at a better time, it was actually one of the most awful times in my life. I was suffering from shouldy values. One in particular, which I'll call \"big house nice car.\" The house wasn't even that big, just bigger than mine. The car wasn't that nice, just nice to have. And somehow this justification made it less shallow. Have you ever heard someone say,\n\n\"When I'm done with school . . . \"\n\n\"When I get that internship . . . \"\n\n\"When I graduate . . . \"\n\n\"When I get a job  . . . \"\n\n\"When I get a better paying job that is actually in my field . . . \"\n\n\"Once I make X per year . . .\n\n. . . then I'll be happy / set / successful.\"\n\nHave you ever heard those words? Was it you saying them? It was definitely me. These are dangerous words. They are a symptom of shouldy values.\n\nThe cure for shouldy values is to be mindful of great values. Your great values. Where I sit, people outsource this type of thinking to religion. Don't. For sure this is a great pool to draw from but, do your own homework. It's actually [a fun exercise](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing).\n\n## The Cure For Shouldy Values​\n\nYou are going to fill out [a bracket for your values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing). Think March Madness, but with values.\n\nI've started you off with [a pretty good list of values](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing). Go through this list or feel free to google \"list of values\" yourself. Write down the ones that resonate with you on a post-it notes. One per note. Don't hold back, if a word catches your eye, write it on a post-it.​\n\n​Don't skip this next step because if you do you will need to start over. You should have a pile of post-it notes now. Divide these post-its into categories: Personal Attributes, Activities, Relationships, Things, Skills. It's easiest to do this with Post-It notes. You might value certain categories more than others. It will become clear why this matters in the last step.\n\nFinally you are going to fill your bracket. Hold a tournament (think March Madness) for each category. Each value is going to compete against another value. Consider a pair of Post-It notes. If you can only have one, which do you choose to keep? The keeper advances to the next round. Do this until you have a clear winner for each category.\n\nThe categories are important because you might value one category over another. I found this was the case with me. Knowledge is one of my top values, but it is a thing and of all the categories I value things the least. Knowledge ended up getting killed by values in other categories. I saw it dropping down the ranks and knew something needed to change.\n\nWhich, brings me to the final step. The bracket is designed to spur your own intuition. It's not designed to be an objective measure. This isn't Highlander, there can be more than one. I actually created a top ten list for each category. You might even need different categories, if you do I'd like to know about it. Really. Tell me. Please.\n\n## Tell Me Your Story.​\n\n​Jamie Dimon once said, \"Leadership is relentless storytelling. We all forget. We all need to be reminded of our purpose. So,\n\nTell me your story.\n\nNow that you have done all of this work,\n\nwhat story is yours to tell?\n\nIt's a story about you, your tribe, and what you do for them.\n\nIt starts with what you believe, what you value. But it can't just be about you. Your story is about what you do to help your tribe to reach their ideal, achieve their goals, or overcome their trials. You need to be really clear about who you are, what you believe and how you stand out. You need to be clear so you can clearly communicate to your tribe. How else will they know? If they share your values then your Why will resonate with them. This is your contribution, what you do to serve them."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"June 12, 2017","title":"What Makes The Difference","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nTwo friends returned to college for their 25th reunion.

The only practice more prevalent is reporting on raw totals: We did this much in sales, we worked this many hours, etc. etc. (See my Key Performance Indicators PDF for a set of great examples.) Averages are terrible:\n\nOne. There are better KPIs that communicate more meaningful information.\n\nTwo. You can be taken advantage of when you rely on averages.\n\n**Did I Tell You About The Time I Dated A Model?**\n\nI asked for her number. She was clearly out of my league and she let me know it. I responded that she was acting like a ten when she was clearly a seven. She agreed! Then she started in on herself about how she needed a nose job.\n\nHer error? She only compares herself to other models (not all women). She blew her nose out of proportion. Her view of the world was distorted and I took advantage. I got her number.\nDon’t be taken advantage of. There are better options.\n\n**Why Averages Perform Below Average In Your KPIs.**\n\nOut of a group of two-hundred KPIs, I have researched the seven top KPIs for Professional Service firms. None of the seven are from taking averages. Six of them are ratios (and the seventh can be). Isn’t that interesting. So what is so great about ratios?\n\n- Ratios reveal trends and make large numbers easier to digest.\n- Ratios provide indicators of organizational performance.\n- Ratios allow me to compare apples to oranges.\n \n\n**Three Keys To Understand And Use Ratios.**\n\nFirst, ratios can be confusing because we were never taught to use ratios in a professional setting. We learned basic fractions. A half or a quarter is an intuitive number. I know what that looks like. I can imagine a pie which gives a fraction meaning. But if a ratio comes out to be 1.09, that is not intuitive. Is it 109%? 92%? Or something else all together?\n\nSecond, not every ratio is great. But the great ones compare two opposing metrics. Let’s look at one of my top seven Professional Services KPIs. Revenue Per Employee. If you are in business then revenue is a positive. More revenue is better. More people isn’t necessarily better. This ratio reflects the sensitivity between these two metrics. More revenue will drive the ratio up. More employees will drive it down. More employees will only drive the ratio up if synergies increase revenue at a greater rate. This ratio simplifies the relationship between revenue and employees down to a number. It also lets me compare two companies that are drastically different in terms of size and revenue.\n\nThird. When I first started learning KPIs I spent a lot of time memorizing definitions. I tried to wrap my head around them. It was hard. I re-learned grade school fractions on Khan Academy because I thought it would help. It didn’t. The memorization didn’t either. For every new KPI I had to memorize a new definition. Don’t waste time memorizing definitions!\nThere is a better way.\n\n**Next time . . . **\n\nIn my next blog I am going to teach you a very simple visual aid that has helped me break down ratios so I don’t have to memorize definitions. Subscribe to my blog so you do not miss it! You might as well pick up my Key Performance Indicators PDF as well.

The exec works at IBM. His boss is Tom Watson Jr, a leader of the information revolution. The issue at hand, a series of mistakes costing several million dollars. These mistakes led to him sitting across from Watson waiting for summary dismissal.\n\n“I suppose after that set of mistakes you will be wanting to fire me.”\n\nWatson’s response is now part of MBA cannon/lore:\n\n>“Not at all young man, we have just spent a couple of million dollars educating you.”\n\n \n\nRemember that the next time you make a mistake at work.

Don’t feel bad.\n\nVerify what legally happened. Employers will “lay off” employees to limit risk of wrongful terminations suits. It is also a pain in the ass that requires a lot of documents. If it comes up during the interview keep your answer brief and to the point: “I worked at (that employer) for X years. I was responsible for . . .”\n\nAsk for a letter of recommendation. It can hurt your pride, but not much else. A letter of recommendation makes calling for references unnecessary. If not from your supervisor, you can get them from other people in the company.\n\nNever lie to a prospective employer.\n\nWith respect to Unemployment Insurance Benefits, do your homework. Rules and/or how they are carried out varies state to state.\n\nDon’t be a victim. It takes two to tango. If your side of the story is a version of “It’s all their fault”, you are only fooling yourself. Advocate for yourself, by avoid blaming, and be objective.\n\nLearn from the experience. Take time for yourself to write down what you have learned from the experience. Share (even if it is only with yourself) the wisdom about yourself and your abilities that you have gained from this experience.\n\n\n## Remember, you are not Justine Sacco.\n\nJustine Sacco used to work as the PR Director for InterActiveCorp (IAC). In 2013 she tweeted to a following of under 200 people,\n\nThen she boarded her flight and turned off her phone for the eleven hour flight. When she turned it back on there was a message from her friend, “You need to call me right now! You are the number one world wide trending topic on twitter.”\n\nJon Ronson does a fantastic job of telling her story:\n\n[![One Tweet Can Ruin Your Life](https://extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jon-Ronson-August-Ames-Feature-Image.jpg)](https://youtu.be/wAIP6fI0NAI)\n\n\n\nRonson doesn’t finish the story. The story ends where it begun with the Gawker editor who first published Sacco’s tweet, Sam Biddle:\n\nJustine Sacco has a PR job she enjoys now, but she deserves the best and biggest PR job, whatever that may be. Give it all to her. Justine Sacco is the most qualified person in her entire field. She has the expertise of ten lifetimes when it comes to dealing with bad press. She survived a genuine personal crisis. She’s unkillable, and smart, and she will tell you to shut up, idiot, it can’t get any worse.\n\nLearn from Justine.

This research has been discussed over and over again: The Power of Habit, Linked: The New Science of Networks, & The Tipping Point.\n\n[![Getting A Job with Social Networks](https://img.youtube.com/vi/g3bBajcR5fE/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/g3bBajcR5fE)\n\nThe white collar workers in Granovetter’s study learned about new job opportunities through acquaintances, rather than close friends. Granovetter showed that weak contacts were twice as effective (28%) as strong contacts (17%) for finding a job. Casual connections were more likely to lead to a job.\n\nThis seems counter-intuitive. On the surface it appears close friends would be better. But if you think about it, you interact with close friends on a regular basis. You consume similar media. By the time they have heard about a new opportunity, so have you. It’s your weak-tie acquaintances, i.e. rarely used gmail contacts, who can tell you about opportunities you would otherwise never hear about.\n\nWhile you process this uncommon sense here’s something else to consider. We assume society is homogenous because pop culture places so much emphasis on the individual. But it’s not! Sociologists have learned that society is made up of groups of people, clusters. Granovetter’s research shows these clusters are particularly important in channeling people into the best opportunities the economy has to offer. People trust and trust in people they know.\n\n>75% of high end white collar jobs were found thru personal contacts or acquaintances, not close friends.\n\n## Take Away:\n(1) Send an email to someone you know (but don’t know very well) and check in.\n\n(2) Use Streak or hubspot, to track who opens your emails.\n\n## “But I don’t know what to say.”\n\nFirst, you are overlooking the power of empathy. You bring value to the table because you understand and can share the feelings of those you connect with. Your job benefits other people, but have you lost sight of your human impact? It’s not the typical focal point of your work. There is value in the connection, but here are some ideas.\n\n- Do any little thing that benefits them, not you.\n- Or just send them a link they might find useful.\n- Still stuck? Okay, send them the link to the post you’re reading right now.\n- If this has helped you it can probably help them too. 😉\n\nOne great idea is Adam Rifkin’s “Five-Minute Favor”: a favor that takes less than five minutes. Imagine taking a couple minutes every day to help someone in a way that’s a small commitment to you, but could be of large benefit to someone else.

Inevitably the prosecution and the defense would take turns interviewing their experts who would present competing evidence. With the internet it is possible for any debate to become a courtroom drama. You can find evidence, facts, and experts that support any believe or opinion. Now for the matter at hand I don’t care if Trump had more attendees or not. My first thought when I see a headline like that is that there isn’t much going on at the moment, (but they have to report on something). I don’t think crowd size at the inauguration is blog-worthy, let alone a press conference, but I believe what has happened here is a microcosm of the larger drama between the Trump Administration and the media. That is worth taking a closer look at.\n\nIt’s worth paying attention because in this case we have access to all the facts. That will not always be the case. We can look at the facts and draw our own conclusion. Kellyanne Conway believes this incident is a “symbol for the unfair and incomplete treatment that this President often receives.” Is that what is happening here? Or do we have, as the Media tells it, a situation where government is brow beating reporters for telling the truth.\n\nRecode does a fair job of covering the issue but there are some other sources I want to reference. It started with the Times reporting that fewer people attended President Trump’s inauguration than President Obama’s in 2009.\n\n![peak_obama_from_wash-monpeak-trump-from-wash-mon](https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inauguration.jpg)\n\nThe Times reports the images were both captured 45 minutes before the oath of office. The Times’ expert, Keith Still, estimates that the crowd on the National Mall on Friday was about one-third the size of Mr. Obama’s. He is a professor at Manchester Metropolitan University in England and a crowd safety consultant. He has consulted for the 2011 royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the Saudi government on crowds for the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.\n\nI tuned in about 10 min before noon. There were performances and prayers just before the swearing in of Vice President Pence. According to the Times attendees were still entering the National Mall up until Mr. Trump’s speech. Better late then never. That is like showing up to a movie for the last 15 min. There obviously was room for them. Fox news provides some additional facts that support the Times’ narrative.\n\nThen Spicer entered the debate. I find it odd that the White House held a special press conference on Saturday ahead of the first scheduled conference on Monday to address the matter. He made five points to refute the Times:\n\n- “This was the first time in our nation’s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.”\n\n- “All of this space from Trump’s platform to the Washington Monument was full when the president took the Oath of Office.”\n\n- “We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama’s last inaugural.”\n\n- “This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.”\n\n- “This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.”\n\nEach of these points have been proven false. I have the same question Chuck Todd asks Kellyanne Conway in the clip below,\n\nWhy send Spicer to the podium to litigate a provable falsehood? Mind you about the smallest, pettiest thing.\n\n>“Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods,” Chuck Todd tells Pres. Trump’s counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning. ~ [Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 22, 2017](pic.twitter.com/Ao005dQ13r)\n\nKellyanne makes a great point, “Presidents are not judged by crowd sizes, they are judged by their accomplishments.” She follows up with the statement,\n\n“I am about things that are quantifiable and important.”\n\nBut the Trump Administration’s actions tell a different story. Is she avoiding the question?\n\nSo is there is such a thing as an alternative fact? Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods. I want to make the argument that we should consider and even seek out facts that contradict our opinions and beliefs. We don’t need to rename them. They are simply fact.\n\nIf proven false they cease to be . . .\n\nfact."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"November 12, 2016","title":"Trumps Win Can Not Be Undone, For Me, It’s Become Personal","expertise":"My Journey","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nHave I been kidding myself all along?

In the wake of Trump’s win the Dow dropped during overnight trading. I was looking for bargains in the market. It is important for me to highlight where my mind was because something had changed and I was not aware.  I had not consumed any media. This wasn’t political upset. This wasn’t the pain of loosing. This wasn’t sadness. This wasn’t mourning.\n\nThis was visceral pain. This was fear. It wasn’t until I am getting off the bus that I realize I am feeling uncomfortable. Three things stand out this morning:\n\n- all the faces on the bus are white.\n- the lavish breakfast spread out for a meeting I'm not invited to\n- the admission of a friend that voted Trump\n\nSomehow each of these pointed to one singular conclusion. It is important to not let emotions control your decisions, but you should never ignore them. My emotions are hijacked with a sense that . . .\n\n \n\n. . .  I do not belong.\n\n \n\nI’ve come to know this feeling well. I feel a sense of accomplishment that I’ve been able to dismiss this feeling. But it still hangs around in the shadows. This week, it stepped out of the shadows. Have I been kidding myself all along? Now I ask, \n\n>do i belong?\n\nDid i ever? My friend assures me he isn’t racist. He says,\n\n>“ My heart goes out to those who are in pain or feel our country has turned its back on them. I hope my thoughts may help clear up some of those inaccuracies so heads can be raised, hope rekindled, friends reunited, and we can move forward as one. I hope you can better understand that I (and most of the 60 million of us) didn’t vote for him out of hatred toward you.”\n\nI’ve had several friends justify themselves on Facebook.  They insist they are not racists. In the days leading up to the election I adopted the words of a gay Trump supporter,\n\n>“Voters do not pull a lever to endorse a candidate’s flaws.\"\n\nThat is still true. But It doesn’t invalidate that I have been wounded. It was not intentional, it was not anticipated. I am equally surprised.  It is nonetheless a wound. I need time to heal. I need to move forward.\n\n \n\n## How Can I Move Forward?\nHere in Utah, I am getting involved in politics for the first time. Regardless of who you support, I invite you to walk with me. Subscribe below and we can walk together. The path forward is not clear. Here are some first steps we can take:\n\n- Get clear on your values.\n- Attend and participate in community meetings.\n- Volunteer with your party.\n- Work on a campaign.\n- Wear a safety pin.\n\nThere’s a growing effort in the United States for people to start wearing a safety pin in the face of attacks and harassment. It is literally a safety pin.  One small way to signal that you’re an ally (regardless of who you voted for) to anyone who feels so out of place in this volatile time.\n\nThe “safety pin” symbol was inspired by the 2014 #illridewithyou movement in Sydney, Australia. People offered to sit next to Muslims who felt threatened on their commutes — at the time, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, they feared an Islamophobic backlash.\n\nFor those that subscribe below I will be creating a community with content, links, and tips for those who are walking this path for the first time. Involvement is more than voting. Involvement is more than knowing about the Utah caucus system. Involvement is a weekly if not monthly engagement. This is a first for me too.

I agreed with Chaffetz, he was a “[fast-track to nowhere.](http://www.cnn.com/2016/11/03/politics/jason-chaffetz-donald-trump-wolf-blitzer)” That leaves me going back and forth between major party candidates trying to decide who I dislike more. What happened? We nominated a “[crazy third world dictator.](http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:comedycentral.com:3b7e4684-ed01-11e0-aca6-0026b9414f30)” It’s a terrible joke. Real events have play out like [rehearsals of Saturday Night Live](https://youtu.be/mXLMR_fc38Q?t=30s).\n\n## A vote for Mcmullin isn’t a vote for Hillary.\n\nChaffetz (@jasoninthehouse), if you can draw the subtle distinction between a vote and an endorsement then you should be able to see that a vote for McMullin isn’t a vote for Hillary. It is a vote for principles. Trump has an established pattern of behavior. He isn’t sorry. He hasn’t changed. He believes he can do anything. He disrespects women as he does the party. But Trump is the star so you will “let him do anything”. I get that YOU need to vote for Trump. To win or at least not give in. Because you have put party before principle. Respect yourself, “If this is the best our party gets [then our party should quit](https://youtu.be/Kbryz0mxuMY?t=2m58s).” Celebrity is a value, but it isn’t one I share.\n\n## Misdirected Voter Values\n\nI’d like to think I can appreciate where Trump votes are coming from. Peter Thiel is a contrarian and supports Trump for president. Thiel is a tech investor most notable for founding Paypal among other name brand tech startups. While the New York Times labeled him toxic, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg defended him saying, “It would set a bad precedent to cut ties with him because of his political views.” In [a speach to the National Press Club](https://youtu.be/ob-LJqPQEJ4?t=2m44s), #NPCLive , Thiel makes several good points:\n\n**Voters do not pull a lever to endorse a candidates flaws.** While this election may appear crazy, it’s less crazy then the condition of our country. It’s not a lack of judgement that leads Americans to vote for Trump. Both major candidates are imperfect people to say the least.\n\n**Median income** is lower than it was 17 years ago. Fact check: While that is true, it is comparing now to a time in the economy just before the tech bubble of 2000 burst. It was a time of excess.\n\n**Student Loan Debt** This is the only country where students take on loans they will never escape, even by filing bankruptcy.\n\n**Government is the problem.** We judge the leadership of our country to have failed. It isn’t surprising to see people vote for Bernie Sanders, or Donald Trump, who is now the only outsider left in the race.\n\nThiel identifies a call for new american politics that overcomes denial, rejects bubble thinking, & recons with reality. He suggests that if we fail to elect Trump we may ask, “Did the new american politics come too late?”\n\nDon’t confuse the strengths of Thain’s oratory with Trump’s strengths. Agree or disagree, Thain is persuasive. He knows his audience: Bernie supporters. I don’t even know if Mcmullan is on his radar. He frames Trump with Bernie. Trump is the last independent candidate. This point has two benefits (1) it speaks directly across the isle to fringe democrats that supported Bernie, (2) it gives Trump supporters something to share with friends and family. He also does a great job of identifying a widely held pain: that Washington is fundamentally broken and that only an outsider can fix it. The flaw in Thain’s argument is the suggestion that Trump is the answer.\n\n## Trumps Plan for America Looks Like A High School Assignment\n\nI googled, “trump plan for America”. To be fair I also googled, “Hillary plan for america”. Trumps big plans are shockingly immature. For example:\n\n- Ensure that the opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, will be easier to access, pay for, and finish.\n\nThat is it. The whole thing looks like is was formatted by a high school student in MS Word. It reads like a vague job responsibility. It is woefully inadequate. It is confirmation of the criticism that he is all buzz and little substance.\n\nIn comparison Hillary’s blog is an inspiration. Literally, the design inspired me to be a better blogger. Visually it is beautiful. I don’t have any issues with Hillary. I have issues with the system. She is a product of that system. She embodies the problems. But she isn’t the problem, they are systemic. She can’t be the change we need.\n\n## We Need To Be The Outsider.\nI agree with Thain whole-heartedly in his call for a new american politics. Hillary cannot fix the problems. Trump cannot fix them either.\n\nEnter McMullin.\n\nMcmullin cannot fix them either. We need to stop waiting on others to fix our problems. We need to stop holding our nose while we wait to see what our parties bring us. That starts with acknowledging our mistake. Republicans have messed up. Instead of acknowledging this they are toeing that party line and pointing the finger at Hillary. That isn’t acceptable.\n\nSo on November 14th when this is old news. I will reach out to my local leadership. I will volunteer. I will learn from my mistakes. I will humbly begin the process of learning to actively participate in the political process.\n\nJoin me.

Sean thinks he has an idea based on the load capacity of the truck that’s carrying it. I am tempted to google the answer by finding the pumpkin at a past event. I don’t, but only because I feel pretty confident. I can estimate the weight. I don’t need to guess. The officiator, Ryan, accepts my guess: “the average of all guesses.”\n\nAfter the submission deadline passes I find out I am not in the winners circle because Ryan forgot to calculate my answer. “Let me add you in.” He says, “But it is going to be high. There were a some really high guesses.” I wait for him to calculate the average.\n\n \n\n## “oh, Crap.”\n\nAt this point I know I’ve placed because Ryan says, “oh, crap.” The winners have already been chosen and I’ve bumped one out of the circle. The problem, Ryan already told him he won! I estimated the weight to within 10 lbs of the true weight!*\n\n \n\n## How to Guess the Weight of any Pumpkin.\n\nIn 1907, Sir Francis Galton asked villagers to guess the weight of an ox. None of them guessed correctly. When Galton averaged their guesses, he arrived at a near perfect estimate. This is the classic example of the “wisdom of crowds”, or collective intelligence. More recently, the show, Brain Games, demonstrates how to guess the number of gumballs:\n\nguess the number of gumballs\n\nPumpkin. Ox. Or gumballs in a machine. The wisdom of crowds has it’s moments. Each person’s perspective holds true information plus some degree of error. The individual errors of each guess get rounded out; they offset each other. Whats left? An estimate of the truth. Everyone getting it wrong, gets it right. It’s the diversity of eccentric perspectives that makes it work!  If we were to plot the answers on a graph you might assume the scatter-plot forms a bell curve: i.e. a lot of people guess close to the right answer. Not necessarily (See below). For sure, it’s not required to. The average is also not popular opinion, that is the mode. In this case the average is the shared consensus we get when we honor our differences.\n\n\n\n## A Caveat: Averages Make for Poor KPIs.\nIt would be a mistake to rely on an average as a KPI. To benefit from the “[wisdom of crowds](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385721706/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=smarexceshor-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0385721706&linkId=4803c6cf0b0092caaabf3bf7286b6a68\n)” we need to meet certain [requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#Four_elements_required_to_form_a_wise_crowd). These requirements are not likely to exist in the context of an SOP. When you use an average as a KPI you are assuming that  it is representative of the whole, and it isn’t.\n\nI often cringe when I see averages. I’ve been working on a resource to help teams create better measurements. I’ve looked and haven’t found one.  The options that I see lack either sophistication or practicality. I haven’t found a resource with both. I’m creating a resource that will (1) show you how to think correctly about KPIs and (2) how to do it in Excel. I invite you to check out what I am doing.

It was curious that my endocrinologist, Dr. Amad, ordered a PET scan. Biopsy is a scary word the first time around, but not the second. Dr Amad took a couple of biopsies of lymph nodes in my neck. He said these could possibly explain the [rise in my Thyroglobulin](http://www.thyca.org/pap-fol/more/thyroglobulin), but he wasn’t convinced. My Dr. referred me to Dr. Amad two years ago, when I was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He ordered the PET scan. I asked why. His response chilled me: “Because I can’t look at your lungs with a sonogram.”\n\n\n\n## Fact 1. Being diagnosed with thyroid cancer actually puts you at higher risk for other cancer.\n\nI didn’t ask, “Why do you want to look at my lungs?” The answer was obvious. One cancer diagnosis didn’t mean I couldn’t have another. Can thyroid cancer spread to the lungs? I learned a thyroid cancer diagnosis actually puts you at [a 33% higher risk for other cancers](http://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/vol-7-issue-4/vol-7-issue-4-p-3-4). The PET scan revealed a 2 cm nodule nestled between my trachea, lung, and a major artery. I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in 2014. I could still have undiagnosed follicular thyroid cancer, which spreads to the lungs. Three different doctors recommended surgery to remove the mass.  \n\n## Fact 2. Food for thought on holistic cancer treatment: Studies show that eating a diet consisting of 20% animal protein contributes to cancer growth.\n\nMarch 2016. While  preparing for surgery, I came across some food for thought on holistic cancer treatment, [The China Study](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937856755&linkCode=as2&tag=aschinastudy-20&linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5). An experiment was originally conducted in 1968 by a pair of Indian scientists, TV Madhavan, & C. Gopalan: [The effect of dietary protein on carcinogenesis of aflatoxin](http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19721301150.html). Campbell built on their original experiment, replicating their results. Campbell showed that a 20% protein diet promotes cancer growth while a 5% protein diet shut it down. Campbell went on on to participate as a member of the China Study team. Praise for [The China Study](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1937856755&linkCode=as2&tag=aschinastudy-20&linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5) is impressive:\n\n\n\n>“The China Study describes a monumental survey of diet and death rates from cancer in more than 2,400 Chinese counties and the equally monumental efforts to explore its significance and implications for nutrition and health.”~ Frank Rhodes, PhD President Emeritus, Cornell University.\n\n>The China Study is the most convincing evidence yet on preventing heart disease, cancer, and other Western diseases by dietary means. ~ Junshi Chen MD, PhD Senior Research Professor, Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety – Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n>The China Study is a well-documented analysis of the fallacies of the modern diet, lifestyle and medicine and the quick fix approach that often fails. The lessons from China provide compelling rationale for a plant based diet to promote health and reduce the risk of the diseases of affluence. ~ Sushma Palmer, PhD Former Executive Director, Food & Nutrition Board – U.S. National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThis research gives me food for thought. There is complexity to eating that extends beyond nutrition. I don’t pretend to understand that complexity. There is a social side, illustrated by this quote from Samuel L Jackson:  “[How can I trust a man who won’t eat a good old-fashioned American hotdog?](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010673/quotes)” There is a emotional side. We use food as a drug. We use foods to treat ourselves; we treat ourselves to ice cream. Thoracic surgery provided me some clarity, I don’t want to do that again. For now, I’ll have that hotdog, but I don’t need one every day.

You can insert multiple blank rows all at once with the following steps:\n\nStep 1: Select the number of rows you want to insert.\n\nStep 2: Right click the selected rows, and choose the Insert item in the context menu, see this video demonstration below:\n\nAlternatively, you can insert one row (right click and select ‘insert’) and then press F4 as many times as you need. This works when you are too lazy to count rows.\n\n## Did you know there are only a handful of tools that differentiate an excel expert from an intermediate user?\n\nYesterday my good friend said, “Anytime someone says they are an excel expert I know they don’t know anything.” I know where he is coming from. I have the same bias. As I learn a new tool in Excel I realize how much more there is to learn. But you don’t have to know how to use every tool to be an expert. When it comes to Excel, it really is possible to become an expert in a short amount of time because there are only about a half dozen areas where people get stuck, bottlenecks. Manipulating data is one area where cut, copy, and paste is just a portion. If you would like to access my (Rho Lall’s) full mind-map,  Become An Excel Expert, it covers all five areas.

Fox had disappeared days before, shortly after she left her apartment for an afternoon jog.  In the days that followed, the neighborhood experienced a heightened level of caution, police presence in the area increased and media and news organizations held a constant vigil across the street from Fox’s apartment complex. It is a romantic suggestion that a neighborhood will come together in tragedy, albeit temporarily.  However, anecdotal evidence does suggest that under such circumstances the criminal element will lay low and bide its time until the heightened level of caution and police presence subsides.  While this makes intuitive sense, is there evidence to support such a conclusion?  This paper is the result of simple question: in the short term, is a neighborhood safer after a murder?  Is there a causal relationship between murder and common street crime?\n\nThe literature suggests two theories on criminal behavior: contagion effect and displacement effect.  These effects provide a theoretical explanation as to why the traditional choice model of constrained optimization does not fully explain the observable variability in crime across space and time.  Under the constrained optimization model, criminals seek to maximize utility given a fixed constraint such as civil and criminal penalties.  Criminals will commit crimes when the expected benefits exceed the expected costs (Becker 1968). Chang indicates that criminals look for easy opportunities; burglars prefer homes, large commercial buildings, or buildings with alleyway access over more closely guarded buildings (2011). This suggests that criminals consider costs and benefits and look to optimize benefits under risk constraints.  However, neighborhood demographics alone do not account for the variability in crime across time and space. Glaeser states, “Positive covariance across agents’ decisions about crime is the only explanation for variance in crime rates higher than the variance predicted by differences in local conditions” (Glaeser 1996, 508).  The gap in explanatory power suggest that there are other significant forces beyond the traditional choice model.\n\nNarayan, Nielsen, and Smyth’s work in the American Journal of Economics and Sociology indicates that there is a natural rate of crime that remains impervious to efforts to reduce crime rate in the long-run (2010). They call short-run variations from the long-run natural crime rate structural breaks.  Contagion and displacement effects are the principal sources of these deviations from the natural rate of crime in a given time and space.\n\nGlaeser explains contagion theory as peers’ influence overshadowing the criminal’s innate disposition towards crime (1996). Peers influence a criminal’s preferences by reducing stigma or increasing social distinction. Through misinformation, peers distort a criminal’s frame of reference and understanding of the costs and benefits. Peers can relax constraints by assisting directly or providing some technology or special knowledge that decreases a criminal’s likelihood of being caught (Glaeser 1996). Contagion effects involve copycats and retaliatory crimes as well (Jacob 2007). When peers’ actions influence a criminal’s decision to act there is a multiplier effect; the neighborhood’s actual crime rate will increase beyond a predicted crime rate based solely on neighborhood demographics (Glaeser 1996).\n\nHesseling explains the displacement effect as an inelastic demand for crime: “offenders are flexible and can commit a variety of crimes; and the opportunity structure offers unlimited alternative targets” (Hesseling 1994, 220). Criminals will not abandon their criminal pursuit at infinitum when encountering an obstacle. Instead, they will seek another opportunity to commit a crime with a similar cost benefit analysis. Criminals alter their course of action in order to bypass “conditions unfavorable to the offender’s usual mode of operating” (Gabor 1990, 66 in Harding 1994). The crime is displaced to “other times, places, methods, targets or offense” (Repetto 1976 in Hesseling 1994, 198). Individuals have a specific desired outcome for committing a crime. Hesseling’s detailed overview of related literature supports the rational choice aspect of displacement theory.\n\nDisplacement can occur in a variety of ways making it difficult to measure and account for. Researchers examine the effect case by case in discussions about motivations and strategy with criminals or in measuring the statistical impact of a policy on crime reduction in a myriad of times and venues (Hesseling 1994). We employ the later methodology.\n\nWe assume that murder, our quasi-experimental treatment, is particularly newsworthy and sufficiently shocking for the neighborhood to react strongly. We predict that we should see an increase in police presence and general wariness among the local population. Inhabitants of the neighborhood will be more cautious and act so as to limit their vulnerabilities for becoming victims themselves. We expect this to have a negative effect on street crime. Criminals will restrain illicit activities until such time where the community and police force are not as alert. Criminals will displace crime into a different area or into a later time period. Murder should have a displacement effect on street crime in the short run.  \n\nOakland, the eighth largest city in California, is rife with crime. It is home to 390,724 people. Since 2007, there have been 874 murders, and 105,589 crimes committed, that is a crime for every four people. Given the high level of crime, it will be the source for our experiment.\n\nThe Oakland Crimespotting project compiles data on crimes from the City of Oakland’s CrimeWatch program which publicizes data from daily police reports. Crimespotting combines crime data and mapping in a convenient matter.  The data comes in a format with a single observation for each crime.  Each observation includes variables that identify the type of crime, location (longitude and latitude), and date when it occurred.  This data is current to the day, and it extends back through 2007. Crimespotting divides the data into thirteen categories: aggravated assault, murder, robbery, simple assault, disturbing the peace, narcotics, alcohol, prostitution, theft, vehicle theft, vandalism, burglary, and arson.  However, Crimespotting does not include data on weather conditions.  It is plausible that weather would influence crime.  Weather Underground offers historic data on the temperature and level of precipitation.\n\nWe aggregate the data because is too granular to work with in its raw state.  We sum the observations across zip codes and by date in order to obtain the total amount of crime for each day in each zip code (or neighborhood). We identify the dates of all murders and subsequently calculate the average amount of crime that occurs in the following week as well as for the week prior.  \n\nWe apply the same process for those neighborhoods that did not experience a murder in order to determine the crime rates in neighborhoods in which a murder did not occur. From this second group we select neighborhoods that are comparable in terms of their crime rates. In order to ensure that we match similar neighborhoods, we restrict the data to a range of two standard deviations from the mean number of crimes committed per day in a zip code with a murder. To determine these cutoff points, we identify the average neighborhood crime rate conditional on there being a murder, which is 7.5.  The lowest average crime rate was 2.8, and the highest was 15 crimes a day. We drop from our data those neighborhood time period combinations that have an average of fewer than 4.5 crimes a day and neighborhoods that have greater than, on average, 10.5 crimes a day. Such a restriction would eliminate neighborhoods on both ends of the crime spectrum. After all, murders in an extremely crime ridden area would likely not illicit the same dramatic response as murders in a more moderate neighborhood. Additionally, neighborhoods with historically low crime rates will not boast substantial enough crime rates to generate any responsible understanding of causal effects.\n\nOur model uses two specifications to determine if street crime in Oakland has any sensitivity to murder:  before and after, and difference in difference.  Both the before and after and difference in difference specifications assume the counter-factual that crime rate will remain unchanged in the absence of a murder in the area in which a murder took place.  The difference in difference also assumes that the general crime-rates in both the treatment and non treatment areas are similar; the standard errors for both groups are statistically equivalent.  If the standard errors are different or if we detect contagion or displacement effects the specification is unsubstantionable.  We check these assumptions with an OLS specification with a lagged variable for when a murder occurs to see its effect on crime.\n\nPreliminarily, we employ the before and after approach and look at only the neighborhoods that have murders.  We compare the crime rates before and after each murder.  This is a basic comparison of the average crime rates in the time periods before and after each murder. For this specification we assume that the crime rate in the post-treatment period is equal to the pre-treatment crime rate in the absence of a murder.  Without any shocks or intervening variables, crime rate should maintain its historical trend.  Thus, any change in the crime rate is attributable to the murder.\n\nThe natural extension of the before and after analysis is to include a control group for comparison.  The difference in difference specification allows us to do this.  We can compare the average crime rates before and after each murder.  We can also compare crime rates between  neighborhoods with murders and those without.  To complete a difference in difference specification we use two dummy variables that partition the sample into four groups.  The first dummy variable, treatment, partitions the sample in two halves based on their treatment status.  The second dummy variable, post, partitions the halves in quarters based on the time period.\n\nWe identify neighborhoods in Oakland that match in terms of crime rates and geographic size. We assume that demographic and macroeconomics variables (economic prosperity, level of unemployment, ethnicity, and association with a given crime group) are held constant across the two neighborhoods during the week long intervals before and after a murder. This is a necessary evil given the lack of data available on such indicators on a scale smaller than the city level.\n\nWe control for several variables.  We assume that crime rates vary based on the date and whether school is on holiday; so, we control for the date a crime was committed. Additionally, we control for the particular neighborhood (zip code). Existing literature indicates that crime rates are highly correlated to drug use. We generate a dummy variable for the first seven days after the first of the month. Government distributes entitlements on the first of the month; therefore, drug addicts will likely spend this disposable income on drugs and spend the next couple of days in a drug induced stupor. Crime should decrease over that short time period. We control for weather, temperature, and precipitation.  It is likely that on hot, dry days crime will increase. However, on cooler or rainy days criminals are more likely to stay of the streets.\n\nOur results indicate that there is no causal relationship between murder and street crimes. (* Indicates a value that is not statistically significant.) Graph 1 depicts the average daily crime rate leading up to and after 40 murders in our sample. The red vertical line is day the murders happen. The black line represents total crime and the other lines represent corresponding crime categories: red for violent crime, green for crimes relating to property, and blue for miscellaneous crimes. This is visual evidence that murder does not have a causal effect on crime.\n\nThe before and after approach reveals that there is not sufficient preliminary evidence to support our hypothesis. A murder in Oakland decreases other street crimes by one twentieth of a crime, .05*. The average week in an Oakland neighborhood sees 8.58 crimes a day.  During the week following a murder, in a given neighborhood street crime drops to 8.53* crimes a day.\n\nThe difference in difference specification does not provide evidence to support our hypothesis.  Murder has a coefficient of 1.3757 (.3008) suggesting that murder, as a treatment, actually is positively correlated with crime rates. A post-treatment time frame variable indicates, on contrast a slightly negative correlation with crime rates. The interaction term between these two variables, and a more holistic view of the difference in difference effect, is .1805* (.4250). While ever so slightly positive, this correlation is statistically insignificant with a relatively large standard error and a particularly small t-statistic (.425). Indeed, only the treatment and the temperature control have a standard error large enough to prove significant (4.574 and 5.280 respectively).\n\nWe note that precipitation, first of the month dummy, and multiples homicides variables boarder on statistical significance. With a t-statistic of -1.806 and a coefficient of -.1802, multiple murders (or a weighted impact of murder) has a negative correlation to crime. On a rainy day, one can expect a small blimp in crime rates. Additionally, with a coefficient of .5362 (.2781), the first of the month dummy variable is positively correlated to crime rates. T-statistics less than 2 render the results dubious. See Table 1 for more details.\n\n###1 Table\n<br/>\n\n\n| Feature          \t| Estimated Coefficient \t| Standard Error \t| T-value \t|\n|------------------\t|-----------------------\t|----------------\t|---------\t|\n| Murder           \t| 1.375720              \t| 0.300775       \t| 4.574   \t|\n| Post             \t| 0.032416              \t| 0.301222       \t| 0.108   \t|\n| MurderPost       \t| 0.180461              \t| 0.425041       \t| 0.425   \t|\n| Temperature      \t| 0.076992              \t| 0.014583       \t| 5.280   \t|\n| Precipitation    \t| 0.010179              \t| 0.005694       \t| 1.788   \t|\n| First Week       \t| 0.526237              \t| 0.278059       \t| 1.893   \t|\n| Multiple Murders \t| -0.180162             \t| 0.099745       \t| -1.806  \t|\n\n<br/>\n\nTo check for the robustness of our model, we replace murder with another high profile crime: arson. Like murder, arson is positively correlated to high rates of crime with a coefficient of 3.598. When interacting with the after treatment variable, arson appears to have a very slight negative effect on crime rates (-.049)*.\n\n \n\nPreviously, we looked at crime as a whole; however, to analyse subtle effects we look at how murder impacts categories of crime. Murder is strongly correlated with violent crimes; however, it is more weakly correlated with property crimes and what we refer to as miscellaneous crimes: disturbing the peace, prostitution, alcohol, and narcotics. The difference in differences mechanism reveals a similar trend, albeit a statistically insignificant one. Murder has a small negative effect on future instances of miscellaneous and violent crimes; however, there was a very small positive correlation with property crimes. See Table 2 for specific figures.\n\n### Tabe 2\n<br/>\n\n\n| Types of crime \t| Estimated Coefficient of Treatment \t| Estimated Coefficient of Post \t| Estimated Coefficient of TreatmentPost \t|\n|----------------\t|------------------------------------\t|-------------------------------\t|----------------------------------------\t|\n| Violent        \t| 1.315547<br/>(0.125213)                \t| 0.030097*<br/>(0.125213)          \t| -0.137175*<br/>(0.176955)           \t|\n| Property       \t| 0.865536<br/>(0.154010)                \t| 0.041623*<br/>(0.154010)          \t| 0.170580*<br/>(0.217631)            \t|\n| Miscellaneous  \t| 0.809375<br/>(0.095011)                \t| 0.018875*<br/>(0.094612)          \t| -0.011316*<br/>(0.133721)                  \t|\n\n<br/>\n\nIf our hypothesis were to hold, murder should have a more dramatic effect on crime rates during the short term (a two day time frame) compared to a long term (a 30 day time frame). However, both time frames yield similar results -.3686* and -.30036* respectively. While, the long term effect is slightly smaller, the difference is insignificant. However, the t-values are -.626 and -.738 respectively.\n\nOur initial question has also gone unanswered due to lack of evidence.  Our simple question was not adequate to illuminate such a complex issue.  We found that murder is strongly correlated with crime, however, our results on the effects of murder on post-murder crime rates proved statistically insignificant and extremely small. The process was valuable in helping us form better ideas about pursuing this area of study.\n\nFundamentally, we need to ask a different question.  We learned that crime is a complex social issue with a lot of variability.  Looking at a short time frame was not beneficial in reducing the impact of this variability.  In light of our research into contagion and displacement effects, had we more time we would revisit our empirical specification.  To assume away contagion and displacement effects on the basis that they were unobserved is ill-advised. To rectify this we would want to explore more substantial time elements beyond the simple time frame of before and after.  Similarly, we would want to look at more subtle geographic variations in crime rates. This would preclude the difference in difference model in favor of another option.  \n\nSimilarly, the lack of controls for neighborhood demographic data concerns us. We cannot find such data at the neighborhood level.  We could have created a variable, day, that counts the days in relation to their relative position to a murder, similar to Graph 1.  We could then use this variable in a fixed effect specification.  Additionally, to test more effectively for geographic displacement, we would want to be able to look at geographic units smaller than the zip code level. However, with the data and tools accessible to us, this was impossible.  Finally, we should expand the study to include a broader range of cities. Any result based solely on Oakland data is not generalizable to the nation or criminology as a whole.\n\nOur theoretical framework is based on the assumption that murder is a sufficiently heinous crime to illicit a strong response to it and therefore to induce a displacement effect in the short run. Ultimately, however, our experiment suggests that murder does not have a strong displacement effect. It simultaneously suggests that murder does not induce a contagion effect.\n \n\n### Bibliography\n\nBecker, Gary S. 1968. “Crime and Punishment: An Economic Approach.” Journal of Political Economy 76:169–217.\n\nChang, Dongkuk. 2011. “Social Crimes or Spatial Crime?

The natural extension of the before and after analysis is to include a control group for comparison.  The difference in difference specification allows us to do this.  We can compare Y as we did for the before and after analysis.  We can also compare Ys between treated and untreated groups.  To complete a difference in difference specification we use two dummy variables that partition the sample into four groups.  The first dummy variable, treatment, partitions the sample in two halves based on their treatment status.  The second dummy variable, post, partitions the halves in quarters based on the time period.  We then interact treatment and post (Post*Treatment); the coefficient on Post*Treatment estimates the statistical difference in Y."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"March 11, 2011","title":"A look At the Fundamental Premise of The Book of Mormon Musical (Old)","expertise":"Artificial Intelligence","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nI was interested in the churches role and influence in Africa so i looked up some numbers.

It measures the stock’s performance relative to a benchmark such as the S&amp;P 500 or the Russell 2000. This model is used to calculate a stocks Beta. A stock with a Beta of one moves in lock step with the market. A stock with a Beta of 1.6 or more is a lot more volatile. A stock with a negative Beta is counter-cyclical, meaning that it moves opposite to the market.\n\nA factor model builds on the CAPM. A factor model may look at other macroeconomics factors such as inflation, the interest rate and other macroeconomic indicators. A company specific factor model would look at company specific factors such as: earnings, P/E, ROE, ROA, ROIC.** If we develop a company specific factor model of the risk premium that includes these variables among other significant variables, we should be able to identify company specific traits with explanatory power.\n\nControlling for these variables we could then look at the effect of environmental litigation on a company’s risk premium, in essence the return to its shareholders. This information would be interesting in determining if litigation serves as a deterrent or if it is just a nuisance. Is the presence of litigation enough to provide an incentive for firms to correct actions?\n\nA current example would be Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon which was at the heart of the BP oil spill last year.

I will discuss FDR’s ideas on the role of government in providing for the general welfare.  I will discuss Regan’s ideas on the same topic.  Finally, I will share a moderate position while reflecting on the ideas of both these men in light of my understanding of their enacted policies.\n\nAccording to “FDR, A Presidency Revealed”, FDR believed in enabling the American people to contribute to the labor-force and protecting the right to work.  He envisioned government programs would lay a strong foundation for the continuation of capitalism and the free market because he valued the American people’s contribution as a vital input in the means of production.  He redefined liberalism; pushing the limits of constitutional powers granted the federal government.  The judiciary pushed back, declaring the newly created NIRA unconstitutional.  FDR attempted to pack the court with sympathetic judges, but lost public support.  His positions also regularly clashed with conservative businessmen of the time.  As President, FDR felt it was his role to stand up and fight for the underdog, who in his eyes consisted of the professional working class.  In 1943, it was clear from FDR’s GI Bill of Rights that he was interested in shaping the society that American troops would come home to.  He did not want American heroes to come home to bread lines and soup kitchens.\n\nIn his 1944 State of the Union Address, FDR makes the argument that to obtain true individual freedom we need the addition of economic rights for the public.  He bases this argument on two assumptions.  First he assumes that “individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.”  He supports this assumption as self-evident: “Necessitous men are not free men”; “people who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.”  Secondly, he assumes that the assurance of equality in the pursuit of happiness is not guaranteed by political rights.  These two assumptions are the foundation for his conclusion that his economic bill of rights will secure the missing foundations required for freedom and liberty.  He defends this ideology with an appeal to goodness:  “We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth— is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.”\n\nRegan also valued the American people’s contribution to the free market.  He believed that people should be free to pursue their private interest and that government’s role is to support this function.  Regan championed the paradigm of supply side economics in the 80’s resulting in the portmanteau reganomics.  His domestic policy can be divided into three parts, each a core tenant of supply side economics: reduce income tax and capital gains tax, reduce government regulation, and reduce the growth of government spending.  Regan’s inaugural speech spoke to each of these tenants.\n\nLower taxes.  Regan argued that all of us together must bear the tax burden.  He stated that, “those who work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.”  This policy has its basis in the Laffer tax model.  Simply stated, at the extremes of a 0% and 100% tax rate the government would not collect any taxes; Laffer concluded that in-between there would be a positive amount of tax receipts and that mathematically there must be at least one maximum point with an associated optimal tax rate.\n\nUnregulated free trade and free markets.  Regan chided his opponents for their temptation in believing “that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.”  He reasoned, “if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?  In this area Regan relies on the principles of supply side economics which encourages individual initiative and entrepreneurship unfettered by government regulation.\n\nPrivatization.  Regan argued that government, like a household,  should live within its means: “Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?  He believed in the private sector: “all must share in the productive work . . . and all must share in the bounty.”  Lastly, he channeled Locke’s ideas that our government has no power except that power that we give it.  He reminded the nation, “the Federal government didn’t create the states; the states created the federal government.”\n\nI don’t care much for political rhetoric.  I am more persuaded by quantifiable results.  For example, I am persuaded by the theoretical and social principles of supply-side economics.  The Laffer model makes logical sense.  However, these models simply lack the support of empirical data; attempts to estimate an optimal tax rate vary greatly (Hsing, Pecorino, Stuart).  For all his effort, FDR’s programs did not end the depression.  However, there is anecdotal evidence that they helped people facing difficult choices.[1]\n\nI agree with FDR that there are basic economic rights that need to be universally available.  First, it is my moral imperative.  Second, it is democratic.  Third, it is sound policy for the long term economic strength of the nation; I submit Bernake’s expertise on the Great Depression and his response to the great recession as evidence.  I believe in three of FDR’s economic rights: the right to a good education, the right to adequate medical care, and the right of every family to a decent home.\n\nHowever, personal development and freedoms would be lost if the remaining rights enumerated in FDR’s Economic Bill of Rights could be demanded as a matter of right.  There is something to be gained in the pursuit of happiness; it is the equal opportunity of this pursuit that must be protected.  Conversely, I challenge his first assumption; there will always be a portion of society that exercises their freedom to be necessitous.  I submit this based on my experience working with the homeless population in New York City.  This idea balks at basic economic assumptions about material goods affect on utility and the nature of choice.\n\nI identify with Republican ideas of fiscal and moral conservatism and I am concerned because the leadership doesn’t support the brand.  This is important because many voters use party affiliation to vet political candidates.  I am troubled by Regan’s deficit spending because it diverges from his political stance and I submit demonstrates a lack of integrity.  Republicans are branded as fiscally responsible but, deficit spending raises questions.  One question that I am now researching is if reganomics has subverted the economic landscape at the expense of small businesses and professionals in order to secure wealth in the hands of the few.  Evidence of this would support the spirit of FDR’s big government policies.\n\nI have touched on two points at the heart of my thoughts and feelings on spectrum of political ideas including those of FDR and Regan.  I would have liked to further explore the empirical evidence for supply-side economics as this is the basis for Regan’s policies.  As such, I have only included a high level summary.   I would also have like to develop a deeper exploration of Bernanke’s ideas on the great depression and how this informed his response to the financial crisis of 2008.  As such, this paper really only serves as a starting point.\n\n\n\n### Work Cited\n\nFDR: A Presidency Revealed. History Channel. Youtube, 2009. Streaming\n\nHsing, Y.

In Chapter 12, Wheelan’s thesis is an answer to this question; “their economies have failed them.”  He goes on to show “that government can sometimes improve market outcomes (Mankiw 7)”, and conversely when economies fail their people so do governments.  Wheelan draws several more conclusions, based on his second thesis.\n\nThe first, “Excessive regulation goes hand in glove with corruption (p. 211).”  Harvard economist Robert Barro has found that government consumption, excluding education and defense, is negatively correlated with per capita GDP, (p. 211).  A less benign corollary is that excessive regulation allows for government officers the opportunity to take bribes from those seeking a way around the regulation. Hernando De Soto’s documented study of opening a business in Peru revealed that it was impossible to start a business legally without bribes. The process was exhaustive and posed a significant barrier to entry in the Market. (p. 211)  Governments interference stifles growth in this case.\n\nHis second conclusion, informal property rights render real estate property less productive, (p. 210).  This means that real property cannot be collateralized.  This stifles growth.  The Economist tells such a story of a Malawian business that cannot raise capital to grow its business despite their “ownership” of a home that would cover the cost.  De Soto reports that such situations result in $9 trillion in uncollateralized real property. (p. 210)  If government would formalize property rights then citizens would be able to collateralize real property stimulating their economies.  Drawing a parallel between these two conclusions shows that government must balance its role.\n\n \n\n## SUPPORT FOR FORMAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n            De Soto’s argument support reform for formalized property rights.  Wheelan doesn’t directly discuss why this issue persists.  There must be reasons, possibly such as protectionist logic or politics.  At the heart of the issue could be that if property is leveraged to incur debt it would be possible for foreign micro lenders to foreclose on the property in the case of default.  Clearly foreign investors would have an advantage.  Even with formal property rights land still belongs to government.  To illustrate lets assume that an owner of land in the US stops paying taxes on that land.  The property will be seized.  Data that would flesh this out would be valuable to De Soto.  Show the benefits through an analysis comparing the benefit to the risk.  Fundamentally the benefit must outweigh the risk because real property cannot be exported to another country. \n\nCHALLENGING GDP AS A MEASURE OF OUR COLLECTIVE WELL-BEING\n\nGDP is a good measure of a countries standard of living because it directly measures production.  A country’s standard of living depends on its production, Mankiw 8.  GDP like any statistic has its limits; Wheelan sympathizes with other social scientists, he illustrates GDP’s shortcomings. He explains alternatives to the use of GDP as a measure of our standard of living such as, “Bennett’s index of leading cultural indicators”, the United Nation’s “Human development index” and Miringhoff’s “social health index” (p. 155). He subtly points out that any measure is a statistic and has limitations. He doesn’t however go on to explain that GDP is an actionable statistic as opposed to these other indexes. He could highlight the direct, causal, relationship between production and standard of living. Allso these other measures are direct or causal. They measure symptoms not causes.\n\n## Notes\n\nWe can split that atom, land on the moon, decode the human genome, yet two billion people live on less than $2 a day.

(Mankiw 9)” He shows that if interest rates are too low then prices will rise but, GDP will ‘hit a wall’. (p. 170) This by definition is inflation. Wheelan draws several more conclusions, based on his second thesis.\nThe first, conclusion is that the great depression was the result of botched monetary policy. The Fed did not intervene as the money supply dried up. Money was hoarded; banks failed and people lost confidence in the banking system. This meant that there were no deposits available for loans. (p. 186) Nobel Prize winner, Robert Mundell, argued that monetary policy in the 1920s led to the great depression, and by extension, the Nazi revolution and World War II. The reason, central banks choose to adhere to gold standard in light of the falling price of gold. They should have chosen a policy emphasizing price stability.  Thus, the severity of the Great Depression could have been reduced.\nHis second conclusion, is that governments can cut their own debts by purposefully causing inflation. His argument is based on three logical points. First, governments often have large debt particularly when facing difficulties. Second, inflation favors debtors as it erodes that value of money they must pay back. Third, government controls the inflation rate. A small unstable government may deliberately cause inflation as a short term solution to buy time. (p. 182) This is not always the motivation. In 1980, US inflation climbed from 3%, in 1972, to 13.5%. Paul Volcker, lead the Fed to raise interest rates to 16%. This resulted in the recession of 1981-82, GDP shrunk by 3% and unemployment climbed to 10%. By 1983 inflation was back to 3%. (p. 172) So governments can intentionally cause inflation.\n\n\n## CHALLENGING MOTIVATION FOR GOVERNMENT INSTIGATION OF INFLATION\n\nGovernments can cut their own debts by purposefully causing inflation for the reasons that Wheelan stated earlier. In Wheelan’s example the government printed money and paid its citizen’s with this money. In this respect Wheelan is right. However, what if this nation owes a debt to the IMF, the World Bank or the US? These loans are likely payable in U.S. dollars. In this instance inflating the local currency would not affect their responsibility to this debt. It is rare that a country could secure a loan payable in their own currency.  Data that would further support this would be a breakdown of government debt and it’s debtors.\nIn summary, this essay showed that governments can sometimes improve market outcomes (Mankiw 7), and that prices rise when the government prints too much money (Mankiw 9). It illustrated these principles using as examples: occupational licensing as encouraged by the teacher’s union, special interest group, since where we stand depends on where we sit, fouled monetary policy and the great depression, and Paul Volker’s anti inflationary monetary policy that lead to the recession of 1981. It looked at several conclusions that Wheelan drew, specifically: support for the special interests and challenging motivation for government instigation of inflation. It drew parallels between the motives for government to purposefully instigate inflation.\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"March 7, 2009","title":"Naked Economics Chapter 9 Summary: Keeping Score","expertise":"Artificial Intelligence","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nNaked Economics Chapter 9 Summary: Boiled down to a simple idea, a country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce.\n","hero_alt":"Naked Economics Chapter 9 Summary: Keeping Score","hero_image":{"childImageSharp":{"gatsbyImageData":{"layout":"constrained","backgroundColor":"#68c878","images":{"fallback":{"src":"/static/e4fb2eefd5776f7be47962595ca68339/87706/naked_economics_chapter_summary.png","srcSet":"/static/e4fb2eefd5776f7be47962595ca68339/f80f8/naked_economics_chapter_summary.png 320w,\n/static/e4fb2eefd5776f7be47962595ca68339/9a63f/naked_economics_chapter_summary.png 640w,\n/static/e4fb2eefd5776f7be47962595ca68339/87706/naked_economics_chapter_summary.png 1280w","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"},"sources":[{"srcSet":"/static/e4fb2eefd5776f7be47962595ca68339/c0bcc/naked_economics_chapter_summary.webp 320w,\n/static/e4fb2eefd5776f7be47962595ca68339/17574/naked_economics_chapter_summary.webp 640w,\n/static/e4fb2eefd5776f7be47962595ca68339/71d4d/naked_economics_chapter_summary.webp 1280w","type":"image/webp","sizes":"(min-width: 1280px) 1280px, 100vw"}]},"width":1280,"height":720}}}},"id":"b56d48db-6c6c-5073-9d25-729ebccba281","fields":{"slug":"artificial_intelligence/naked-economics-chapter-9-summary"},"parent":{"id":"97b2af17-1acd-5f07-957e-495e015e669a","name":"naked-economics-chapter-9-summary","modifiedTime":"2025-10-18T03:44:04.059Z"},"body":"\n## KEEPING SCORE: A country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce.\n\nIn Chapter 7, Wheelan’s thesis is that a country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services.  This thesis is developed through an explanation and defense of GDP as an indicator of a nation’s prosperity.  He draws several conclusions to support this.\n\nThe first is that “any measure of economic progress depends on how you define progress. GDP just adds up the numbers.  All else equal, it is better for a nation to produce more goods and services than less (p. 155).”  He illustrates this with an example of how the real cost of goods decreases with time despite inflation raising the nominal cost.  He does this by measuring the real cost of living in time, the time it takes to earn the money equivalent to the price of the goods.  Thus, in 1900 it cost one hour and forty-one minutes of labor to purchase a pair of stockings. Today, it costs 18 minutes of labor to purchase a pair.\n\nThe second conclusion, GDP reflects more than just a number; “When GDP turns negative, the damage is real: jobs lost, businesses closed, productive capacity turned idle (p. 156).”  He illustrates the significance of India’s per capita GDP of $440.  In India there are 500,000 cases of leprosy.  The medication to cure leprosy only costs $3 and is provided for free by the World Health Organization.  However, their health care network is not structured to effectively diagnose and administer the medication.\n\n \n\n## DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICS: Governments can sometimes improve market outcomes.\n\nWhy does half the world’s population live on less than $2 a day?  In Chapter 12, Wheelan’s thesis is an answer to this question; “their economies have failed them.”  He goes on to show “that government can sometimes improve market outcomes (Mankiw 7)”, and conversely when economies fail their people so do governments.  Wheelan draws several more conclusions, based on his second thesis.\n\nThe first, “Excessive regulation goes hand in glove with corruption (p. 211).”  Harvard economist Robert Barro has found that government consumption, excluding education and defense, is negatively correlated with per capita GDP, (p. 211).  A less benign corollary is that excessive regulation allows for government officers the opportunity to take bribes from those seeking a way around the regulation. Hernando De Soto’s documented study of opening a business in Peru revealed that it was impossible to start a business legally without bribes. The process was exhaustive and posed a significant barrier to entry in the Market. (p. 211)  Governments interference stifles growth in this case.\n\nHis second conclusion, informal property rights render real estate property less productive, (p. 210).  This means that real property cannot be collateralized.  This stifles growth.  The Economist tells such a story of a Malawian business that cannot raise capital to grow its business despite their “ownership” of a home that would cover the cost.  De Soto reports that such situations result in $9 trillion in uncollateralized real property. (p. 210)  If government would formalize property rights then citizens would be able to collateralize real property stimulating their economies.  Drawing a parallel between these two conclusions shows that government must balance its role.\n\n \n\n## SUPPORT FOR FORMAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\n            De Soto’s argument support reform for formalized property rights.  Wheelan doesn’t directly discuss why this issue persists.  There must be reasons, possibly such as protectionist logic or politics.  At the heart of the issue could be that if property is leveraged to incur debt it would be possible for foreign micro lenders to foreclose on the property in the case of default.  Clearly foreign investors would have an advantage.  Even with formal property rights land still belongs to government.  To illustrate lets assume that an owner of land in the US stops paying taxes on that land.  The property will be seized.  Data that would flesh this out would be valuable to De Soto.  Show the benefits through an analysis comparing the benefit to the risk.  Fundamentally the benefit must outweigh the risk because real property cannot be exported to another country. \n\nCHALLENGING GDP AS A MEASURE OF OUR COLLECTIVE WELL-BEING\n\nGDP is a good measure of a countries standard of living because it directly measures production.  A country’s standard of living depends on its production, Mankiw 8.  GDP like any statistic has its limits; Wheelan sympathizes with other social scientists, he illustrates GDP’s shortcomings. He explains alternatives to the use of GDP as a measure of our standard of living such as, “Bennett’s index of leading cultural indicators”, the United Nation’s “Human development index” and Miringhoff’s “social health index” (p. 155). He subtly points out that any measure is a statistic and has limitations. He doesn’t however go on to explain that GDP is an actionable statistic as opposed to these other indexes. He could highlight the direct, causal, relationship between production and standard of living. Allso these other measures are direct or causal. They measure symptoms not causes.\n\nIn summary, this essay showed that governments can sometimes improve market outcomes and a country’s standard of living depends on its ability to produce goods and services. It illustrated these principles using as examples: the real cost of goods measured in time, India’s per capita GDP, De Soto’s research in real property and his study of corruption in government. It looked at several conclusions that Wheelan drew, specifically: GDP is a good measure of a countries standard of living because it directly measures production, GDP reflects more than just a number, excess government regulation leads to corruption, however, informal property rights hinder development.  It drew parallels between positive and negative government interaction."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"February 28, 2009","title":"Organized Interests.

This theory argues that the quantity of money available determines the price level and the value of money.  It is a direct cause of inflation.  More money available in the market drives the price level up and the value of money down.  The devaluation of money is inflation. \n\nFriedman was a passionate debater who fought the Keynesian model.  Friedman had long held philosophical position that the true test of a theory is whether it correctly predicts events.  On this base Friedman argued two main points.  In an analogy, if an economy were a car government is usually a lousy driver.  In direct contrast to the Keynesian position, he argued the economy’s brake and accelerators have little to do a fiscal policy. \n\nHe started an intellectual movement whose beliefs are encapsulated in monetarism.  Monetarism asserts that that changes made to the money supply are most material in the business cycle and in long run.  In the short run money can sway is not just prices but also economic activity. In the long run money supply only changes price.  Monetarists believe the economy’s accelerator is ‘a higher money supply’ and the economy’s brake is ‘lower money supply’.  According to, A Monetary History of the United States, ineffective monetary policy accompanied every severe recession and every significant inflationary period over the past and century (page 242).  The Federal Reserve is responsible for monetary policy.  The Fed affects the money supply through open market operations, the discount rate, and the reserve ratio.  They effectively hold the reigns of the economy.\n\nHe also worked on the idea of money velocity or how fast money changes hands in an economy.  The rate at which the money stock turns over each year is called the velocity of money.  Monetarists believe That velocity is stable, Keynesians see is unstable.  Historical data supports the monetarist position; as nominal GDP and the money supply increase velocity has stayed constant."},{"frontmatter":{"date":"January 25, 2009","title":"New Ideas from Dead Economists: Maynard Keynes","expertise":"Artificial Intelligence","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nKeynes provided an alternate school of thought and a solution.

He directly attacks Say’s Law which states that producing goods provides workers with enough income for all goods to be purchased. Therefore resulting in zero surplus. If income was saved and not spent on goods then the savings would be utilized for business investment which would make up the difference. In the instance that investment didn’t make up the difference a recession would ensue but, the resulting drop in prices and wages would soon end it. This is the classical school of economics. Keynes did not believe that saving equaled investment. He argued that savers and investors do so for various reasons. He also argued that in a recession workers who are laid off are unable to save and businesses are reluctant to invest.\n\nKeynes provided an alternate school of thought and a solution. Keynes introduced the idea of marginal propensity to consume; a number that indicates a persons likeliness to spend an extra dollar. He used this to develop a formula for his keynesian multiplier. His idea was that any increase or reduction in production will produce a multiplier effect that magnifies the change by a factor of the multiplier which is based on the aggregate MPC. His solution was for government to spend public resources so as to fill the gap left by consumption and investment.\n\nHe created an entirely separate school of thought. People who identify with this school are considered Keynesian. This theory is characterized by a belief that private economy may not reach full employment and that public spending by the government can fill the void.

The BI Triangle has the power to turn ordinary ideas into great fortune.   \n\n![BI Triangle](./media/content/bi_triangle.png)\n\n## Questions to ask:   \n\n- How is it that you have so many businesses and other people can barely handle one?\n- How does your business grow while other people stay small?\n- How do you have free-time when other business owners work constantly?\n- Why do so many businesses start and then fail so quickly?\n\n## why build a business?\n\n**Excessive cash flow.** In his book How To Be Rich, J. Paul Getty states that his first rule is that you must be in business for yourself. \nThis allows them the free time and extra money to keep investing in more and more assets, more assets tax free.\n\n**Sell it.** For someone to be valuable, for something to be valuable, there must be many more people than you who want it.\nIf you can build a successful business, you will always have a lot money.\nIf you learn to build a successful business, you will have developed a profession that few people ever achieve. \nAs a business owner, you only need to get it right . .. once.\n\n**To build a business and take it public.** This was RD's idea of becoming an ultimate investment.\n\nYou're never too old and you're never too young.\n\nThe BI triangle outlines primary technical skills that are required as\n\n- Vision: The ability to see what others cannot see. \n- Courage: The ability to act despite tremendous doubt.\n- Creativity: The ability to think outside the box.\n- The ability to withstand criticism: There is not one successful person who has not been criticized. \n- The ability to delay gratification: to be very disciplined, to learn to deny short-term and immediate self gratification in favor of a greater long-term reward.\n\n## Mission:\n\nA business can have both a spiritual and a business mission to be successful, especially at the beginning. \nIf the mission is clear and strong, the business will weather the trials every business goes through during its first 10 years.  \nWhen a business gets big and it forgets its mission, or the mission it was created for is no longer needed, the business begins to die.\n\nMany people start a business only to make money... \nThe mission of a business should fill a need the customer wants. If fulfills that need well, the business will begin to make money.\nWhen a spiritual mission and business mission are both strong and in mind, the combined power builds.\nA mission must be preserved long after the entrepreneur is gone, or the business dies.\n\n## Team\n\nMany entrepreneurs, they'll really become business people, until after they leave their first business. Experience is a better teacher.\nOne of the first things to look at when evaluating a business, such as looking at a business to invest in or to buy stocks in, is the team running it.\nOne of the biggest problems businesses have is they personally lack experience and they have no team behind them, a team that inspires confidence.\nFor example, a business looking to go public should have someone on the team that has experience taking business public.  \nLooking at a business plan, one of the lines you should check is the line item under salary.\nA high salary reveals an entrepreneur is not interested in creating a business but more creating jobs and lining their wallet.  \nAs an investor, you should invest in management.  Not an idea.  You want to look for management team that has experience, passion and commitment.   \n\nOne of the reasons for creating CashFlow the board game is so you can learn to operate as a member of a team and as an individual.  \nAnother thing to note, \"money follows management\".  \n\nBusiness is a team sport. Investing is a team sport.\nIn school, they train students to take tests on their own. If a child attempts to cooperate at that time, it's called cheating. \nRich dad would also say, in the real world, that there's not business owners cooperate at that time, and in the world of business, every day is test time.\n\nImportant lesson: People in the E and S quadrant often make less money they could or would like to, because they attempt to do things on their own. \nEspecially those in the E quadrant, they form a union, instead of a team. \nThere's a perfect example of an individual trying to trade against the well organized team.\n\nThe people who want to become sophisticated investors and above must invest as a team.  \nOn Rich Dad's team, we are accountant attorneys, brokers, financial advisors, insurance agents, and bankers.\nWhen I was first starting out, I dreamed of having my own team of accountants and attorneys, not a boat.\nMy CPA was minding about 30 other businesses on that day alone.\nIn comparison, I could see a team of people working only on Rich Dad's business. \nIn the working areas, his office was a row of bookkeepers, about 14 of them. \nFive full time accountants, chief financial officer. He also had two full time attorneys working for him in his main office.\n\nAs I said, most people work hard, and dream of getting away on their boat. \nI first dreamed of having a team of full time accountant and attorneys. \nThat is why I could now have a big boat, and the free time. A matter of priority.\n\n#### Natural Tetrahedron\n\nA team forms a natural tetrahedron. A natural tetrahedron has the nature comprised of air, fire, earth, and rain.  \nEach person tends to be weighted predominantly in one of these elements, although we all have some part of each of the four.  \nIf you only put two elements together, as in a partnership, you get some strange phenomena:\n\n- Air and water equal spray.\n- Air and earth equal dust.\n- Water and earth equal mud.\n- Earth and fire equal lava and/or ash.\n- Fire and water equal steam.\n- Fire and air equal flame.\n\nPeople came and went until the right tetra-team finally locked into place.  Once this stabilized, it begins to radiate out, growing rapidly and with stability.   \n\n## Leadership\n\nTroops do not follow a leader who does not lead.\nThe most important quality of a leader is trust.\nA leader's job is to bring out the best in people, not to be the best person.\nIf you are the smartest person on your business team, your business is in trouble.\nVolunteer more... at your Church, take on projects.  At work, volunteer to lead projects.\nA Leader's roles are a combination of:\n\n- Visionary.\n- Cheerleader.\n- Pit boss.\n\nAs a visionary, the leader must keep his or her focus on the corporate mission.  \nAs a cheerleader, he or she must inspire the team as they work together toward that mission, as well as herald success along the way.   \nPit boss, he or she must be able to make tough calls regarding issues that distract the team from achieving the mission, \nto take effective action while maintaining focus.   \nWith the right mission and team, you are well on your way to building a strong business.\n"},{"frontmatter":{"date":"August 8, 2007","title":"Answers from a life coach: What do you do for a living?","expertise":"AI Strategy","author":"Rho Lall","short":"\nWhat do you do for a living?
