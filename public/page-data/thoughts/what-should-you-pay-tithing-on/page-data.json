What I\\u2019ll cover from here probably is. Note that tithing has repeatedly been defined at 10%. Pay 9%, you aren\\u2019t obeying the commandment. Pay 11%, no extra blessings. It\\u2019s 10%. So for a Mormon, calculating 10% tends to become somewhat of an exact science.

Your employer likely offers some benefits. Maybe a retirement match, a flexible savings account, life insurance, disability insurance, \\u201Cfree\\u201D meals, or health insurance.

There\\u2019s no allowance for an extra 10%.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"I have not yet figured out how to deal with that other than the fact that I don\\u2019t plan to pay for every single dime of my children\\u2019s education using 529 money.

For example, at very high marginal tax rates many of us decide to work less. It just isn\\u2019t worth it when 46% of everything you earn goes to the government.
