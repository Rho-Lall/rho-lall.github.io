These effects provide a theoretical explanation as to why the traditional choice model of constrained optimization does not fully explain the observable variability in crime across space and time.  Under the constrained optimization model, criminals seek to maximize utility given a fixed constraint such as civil and criminal penalties.  Criminals will commit crimes when the expected benefits exceed the expected costs (Becker 1968). Chang indicates that criminals look for easy opportunities; burglars prefer homes, large commercial buildings, or buildings with alleyway access over more closely guarded buildings (2011). This suggests that criminals consider costs and benefits and look to optimize benefits under risk constraints.  However, neighborhood demographics alone do not account for the variability in crime across time and space. Glaeser states, \\u201CPositive covariance across agents\\u2019 decisions about crime is the only explanation for variance in crime rates higher than the variance predicted by differences in local conditions\\u201D (Glaeser 1996, 508).

Contagion and displacement effects are the principal sources of these deviations from the natural rate of crime in a given time and space.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Glaeser explains contagion theory as peers\\u2019 influence overshadowing the criminal\\u2019s innate disposition towards crime (1996). Peers influence a criminal\\u2019s preferences by reducing stigma or increasing social distinction.

Peers can relax constraints by assisting directly or providing some technology or special knowledge that decreases a criminal\\u2019s likelihood of being caught (Glaeser 1996). Contagion effects involve copycats and retaliatory crimes as well (Jacob 2007). When peers\\u2019 actions influence a criminal\\u2019s decision to act there is a multiplier effect; the neighborhood\\u2019s actual crime rate will increase beyond a predicted crime rate based solely on neighborhood demographics (Glaeser 1996).\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Hesseling explains the displacement effect as an inelastic demand for crime: \\u201Coffenders are flexible and can commit a variety of crimes; and the opportunity structure offers unlimited alternative targets\\u201D (Hesseling 1994, 220).

Criminals alter their course of action in order to bypass \\u201Cconditions unfavorable to the offender\\u2019s usual mode of operating\\u201D (Gabor 1990, 66 in Harding 1994). The crime is displaced to \\u201Cother times, places, methods, targets or offense\\u201D (Repetto 1976 in Hesseling 1994, 198). Individuals have a specific desired outcome for committing a crime.

Each observation includes variables that identify the type of crime, location (longitude and latitude), and date when it occurred.  This data is current to the day, and it extends back through 2007. Crimespotting divides the data into thirteen categories: aggravated assault, murder, robbery, simple assault, disturbing the peace, narcotics, alcohol, prostitution, theft, vehicle theft, vandalism, burglary, and arson.

To determine these cutoff points, we identify the average neighborhood crime rate conditional on there being a murder, which is 7.5.  The lowest average crime rate was 2.8, and the highest was 15 crimes a day. We drop from our data those neighborhood time period combinations that have an average of fewer than 4.5 crimes a day and neighborhoods that have greater than, on average, 10.5 crimes a day. Such a restriction would eliminate neighborhoods on both ends of the crime spectrum.

The difference in difference also assumes that the general crime-rates in both the treatment and non treatment areas are similar; the standard errors for both groups are statistically equivalent.

To complete a difference in difference specification we use two dummy variables that partition the sample into four groups.

We generate a dummy variable for the first seven days after the first of the month. Government distributes entitlements on the first of the month; therefore, drug addicts will likely spend this disposable income on drugs and spend the next couple of days in a drug induced stupor.
