Ashen faces, gray matted hair and clothes: the dead appeared to rise up from the subway. They came in waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2001 I was an adult, but just barely. I had just arrived home from living abroad and needed a job. There was this new thing called the internet. I could search for jobs without having to leave my apartment. My mom was not impressed. She didn’t care. If she was outside, I needed to be outside. I could apply online but when I was done I needed be outside looking for work and not come back until after she was home. I remember that fight; it was September 10th.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next morning, I made phone calls and faxed out my resume. The jobs were posted online, but I still had to fax my resume to most of them. I prepared to make my way out the door. My dad called in a panic. He asked for my mom! He asked for my sister! He wanted to know where they were. He wanted to know if they were okay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Why?&amp;quot; I asked. &amp;quot;What&amp;#x27;s going on?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“You don&amp;#x27;t know, turn on the television.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I turned on the TV and asked, “What channel?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dad never answered.
It didn&amp;#x27;t matter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At that point, my experience is probably quite common. I see tower one smoking. I see the plane hit tower two. From my apartment, I can&amp;#x27;t see the World Trade Center. I can’t hear the buildings collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the jet fighters scream past my building, I hear them just fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call waiting rang, my mom was on the other line. She asks for my sister! Is she okay?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My sister attended a local college by the World Trade Center. Her train passed through World Trade Station. She was underground when the attack happened. She had no way of knowing what was going on above her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mom?&amp;quot; I asked, &amp;quot;do you still want me to go out to look for work?&amp;quot; As terrified as we were that day, I was still more scared of my mom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not today.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We didn&amp;#x27;t hear from my sister. Minutes became hours. Finally, a call came from a payphone; She had evacuated the train into a tunnel. With train services disrupted, it would be take time to come home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last stop on the A line is never crowded. That day was different. I met my sister at the top of the stairs. Waves of people emerged from the subway. The last of the waves were covered in ash. Only their eyes showed they were alive. Ashen faces, gray matted hair and clothes: the dead appeared to rise up from the subway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As each wave emerged, a pair of Yemeni brothers who owned the corner store selflessly offered water to those in need. They faced anger, threats, and ignorant comments in the days and weeks that followed, but what sticks with me is their act of kindness, extending water to those outstretched grey hands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That image lingers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my Irish neighborhood across from Good Shepherd church the bagpipes play at funerals. In the months that followed I heard bagpipes. Every Saturday. Multiple times a day and during the week. The bagpipes played. Many of them for first responders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sound lingers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Gotta Start Somewhere]]></title><description><![CDATA[

If I made a movie about my life, a lot of that movie would be scenes of me watching Youtube. That doesn&amp;#x27;t sound very interesting. Nonetheless, I am watching a video of a graffiti artist on YouTube talking about the time and energy that he puts into his craft. He&amp;#x27;s spent 10 years understanding the basics. Not fancy. Not complicated. Basics. 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hear that and think, “Man, I don&amp;#x27;t think I&amp;#x27;ve done anything for 10 years!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spend some time thinking about that and true to form I overanalyze. I think about it. I think a lot. Yes. ;-) I&amp;#x27;ve over-thought about things my entire life. I&amp;#x27;m a thinker. I  think deeply about stuff. All kinds of stuff. That&amp;#x27;s what I am do. I&amp;#x27;m pretty damn good thinker. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway. There are things that I am. I am a parent. I am married. What I am and what i do are not the same. This is about dedicating time and energy to an activity, a craft, or skill. Well, I&amp;#x27;ve worked. Actually, I have added to my knowledge related to work consistently for over 10 years. Try 20. I’ve dedicated myself to a serious study of business. What I&amp;#x27;ve done in business has changed over the years. That ability to adapt and change quickly, learn new technologies as I implement them, pays dividends. I can innovate. Stay fresh. Stay new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It takes longer than it should but after some time it hits me. Obviously. Data is my bread and butter. My medium isn&amp;#x27;t a marker, pen, or paint. Data is my medium. Analysis is my craft. I’ve been doing that forever. That&amp;#x27;s my thing. That&amp;#x27;s what I&amp;#x27;ve the last 20 years doing. That is what I will do for the next 20 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the flip side of the same question, “What should I invest my next 10 years doing? If I am spending the next 10 years developing a skil, day in and day out, what skill would that be? What do I want that to be? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storytelling. I want to be a storyteller. I want to tell stories. I realize I’m not great at it. I&amp;#x27;m really good at thinking. I can talk alot. I&amp;#x27;m really good at boring people as I talk. At least I recognize that. This isn’t a story, I can see that. I can see the holes and the warts. Gotta start somewhere. It’s a start. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tithing: Should You Pay On Your Gross or Net Income?]]></title><description><![CDATA[
Tithing: Should You Pay On Your Gross or Net Income? The next time someone shares the “gross or net blessings” argument, share this with them . . .

]]></description><link>https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/my-journey/tithing-should-you-pay-on-your-gross-or-net-income</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/my-journey/tithing-should-you-pay-on-your-gross-or-net-income</guid><pubDate>Tue, 19 Feb 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Tithing is one of the most important commandments in the LDS church. It’s the only commandment we have to declare our compliance with once a year, and it’s required if you want a temple recommend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s at least one story each month in the Ensign or New Era dedicated to the blessings of tithing. It’s simple, right? Donate 10% of your income to the church and you’ll get the blessings. As simple as 10% sounds, though, how much tithing you pay can actually get complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A little history on tithing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tithing has been around for a long time. The first mention of it comes in Genesis 14, where Abram gave tithes to Melchizedek, the king of Salem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paying tithing is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/64.23&quot;&gt;excellent fire insurance&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also been promised that if we pay tithing, the blessings that come will be &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/ot/mal/3.10&quot;&gt;more than we can receive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the modern church, Joseph Smith received a revelation now known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/119&quot;&gt;Doctrine and Covenants section 119&lt;/a&gt;. In it, the Lord said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we view that revelation to mean 10% of your income. But the law wasn’t always interpreted that way. And I’m not talking about how people used to tithe with eggs or potatoes or pigs. Rather, how much tithing you paid was based on your net worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you’ve probably noticed, the church has made a push recently to publish more about its history in context. As part of that effort, Steven C. Harper from the Church History Department wrote an &lt;a href=&quot;https://history.lds.org/article/the-tithing-of-my-people?lang=eng&quot;&gt;article about tithing in the early days of the church&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harper shares that after Edward Partridge heard the revelation in a Sunday reading, he wrote a letter to Newel K. Whitney. In it, he shared the law as applying to interest members would earn if they invested their net worth for a year:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If a man is worth a $1000, the interest on that would be $60, and one/10. of the interest will be of course $6.” (6% was a common interest rate at the time)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://juvenileinstructor.org/understanding-interest-in-joseph-smiths-original-tithing-revelation/&quot;&gt;another interesting article&lt;/a&gt; about the original intent of the revelation. It’s impossible to say when the church began to interpret the law of tithing as one-tenth of our income, but that is the current commandment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Gross or net income?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like I said before, 10% isn’t as simple as it sounds. When having the discussion about whether you should pay your tithing on gross or net income, it wouldn’t surprise me if you’ve heard the question: “Well, do you want gross or net blessings?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This question is always rhetorical (who’s going to say they want net blessings?) and usually ends the conversation. I heard it for the first time shortly before my mission. I resolved then and there that I’d always qualify for gross blessings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we married, my wife said something about paying on net income, but I wouldn’t have it. Then, a couple years ago, my wife and I were in a bishop’s office going over our budget. We needed a little financial assistance from the ward and were happy to walk through our income and expenses with the bishop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He first asked me what my take-home pay was. After I told him, he automatically calculated our tithing based on that amount. I was confused. Does my bishop pay on net? Didn’t he want gross blessings?!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The church’s stance on tithing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the church has no official stance on whether you should pay tithing on your gross or net income. This is the statement the First Presidency made in 1970. As of yet, nothing has superseded it:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The simplest statement we know of is the statement of the Lord himself, namely, that the members of the Church should pay ‘one-tenth of all their interest annually,’ which is understood to mean income. No one is justified in making any other statement than this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Every member of the Church is entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the Lord and to make payment accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In other words, how you define your income for tithing purposes is between you and God. It’s not up to your bishop, your stake president or any of the general authorities to decide for you. Of course, some of these men may have opinions on how you should calculate your income. But they’re not justified in setting that number for anyone but themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Keep it simple&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Things can get really complicated if you spend too much time calculating your income. For example, what happens if you pay on gross income but die before you receive Social Security income and Medicare coverage. Was that Social Security and Medicare tax actually income?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what if you don’t get a tax refund, should the federal and state income tax you paid the previous year be no longer be considered income? What about investment income that’s not yet realized because you haven’t withdrawn it from the account? If the stock market crashes the next year and you lose all those unrealized gains, were they really income in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OK, let’s take a deep breath before you and I pop a blood vessel thinking about all of this. When doing tithing settlement at the end of the year, the bishop won’t ask you for a W-2 form or tax return to verify your “full tithe” declaration. And that’s how it’s supposed to be. You don’t need to get all intense in determining what’s income and what isn’t. Simplicity is, after all, a principle of the Gospel. Do what you feel comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And the next time someone shares the “gross or net blessings” argument, share this with them 😉&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the official statement of the church in mind, that kind of argument effectively seeks to take away a person’s agency. It makes them believe that they may be robbing God or will receive lesser blessings for paying on their net income. That’s just not true. However you decide to pay your tithing, do it prayerfully and honestly. That’s all God asks for.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Should You Pay Tithing On?]]></title><description><![CDATA[
The only discussions I ever see in both Sunday school classes or on the internet seem to center around the gross versus net question. I suspect I have spent more time thinking about tithing than anyone else on the planet. We’ll dive deep into the topic and discuss some questions you’ve probably had and probably a few you’ve never thought about.

Dahle, MD. He blogs at &lt;a href=&quot;www.whitecoatinvestor.com/&quot;&gt;The White Coat Investor&lt;/a&gt;, and also wrote “The White Coat Investor: A Doctor’s Guide to Personal Finance and Investing.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to tithing, my belief aligns with the 1970 First Presidency letter on the subject: “Every member of the Church is entitled to make his own decision as to what he thinks he owes the Lord and to make payment accordingly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dahle’s analytical perspective is a fun read. These are some interesting things to consider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have been writing a blog where I help doctors and other high-income professionals stop doing dumb things with their money for the last six years. It is the most widely read physician-specific personal finance and investing website in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over that time period, many of my readers have figured out that I’m Mormon. As such, they ask me for my thoughts on tithing. I suspect I have spent more time thinking about tithing than anyone else on the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The only discussions I ever see in both Sunday school classes or on the internet seem to center around the &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/tithing-should-you-pay-on-your-gross-or-net-income&quot;&gt;gross versus net question&lt;/a&gt;. However, tithing can be way more complicated than that. In fact, it can be so complicated, that every time I think about it I see the wisdom in the common recommendation that it’s between you and God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That recommendation is where I will start and finish this discussion.&lt;/strong&gt; In the middle, we’ll dive deep into the topic and discuss some questions you’ve probably had and probably a few you’ve never thought about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The basics of tithing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A tithe is 10% of your income that you pay to the church. It pays for things like:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chapels&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Temples&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Printed materials&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Church employee salaries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Other expenses required to run a worldwide church&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the devout Mormon, a tithe is a commandment. If you don’t pay your tithing in full, you can’t go to our most sacred of buildings, the temple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, tithing comes with a promise. As God said through his prophet Malachi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse…and prove me now herewith…if I will not…pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it….I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall not destroy the fruits of your ground….and all nations shall call you blessed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, tithing is a commandment, and we can expect to be blessed for keeping it.The implication seems to be that the blessing is both temporal and spiritual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunday school is full of stories of latter-day saints who paid their tithing despite financial challenges and then were rewarded financially for doing so. And if that isn’t enough of a blessing, it also serves as fire insurance in the second coming, as noted in Doctrine and Covenants 64:23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Extra tithing = extra blessings?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve been in the church for a long time, what I’ve written above probably isn’t new to you. What I’ll cover from here probably is. Note that tithing has repeatedly been defined at 10%. Pay 9%, you aren’t obeying the commandment. Pay 11%, no extra blessings. It’s 10%. So for a Mormon, calculating 10% tends to become somewhat of an exact science. Most Mormons calculate their tithing to the dollar, if not the penny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Your benefits&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;s
Here’s something you W-2 employees out there have probably never thought about. Your employer likely offers some benefits. Maybe a retirement match, a flexible savings account, life insurance, disability insurance, “free” meals, or health insurance. Your employer also pays half of the payroll tax (Social Security and Medicare) as well as unemployment tax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are those a business expense or are they part of your salary? If you bought those things on the open market, you would be doing so with post-tax (and presumably post-tithing) dollars. So why does the fact that your employer gives them to you change how much you pay in tithing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this respect, a self-employed Mormon is at a disadvantage. I doubt any employed person is adding the employer half of his Social Security taxes back to his gross income before calculating his tithing, much less the unknown employer portion of his family’s health insurance premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So perhaps the self-employed person should be subtracting those costs out of his gross income before calculating his tithing. I also haven’t paid tithing on free meals and similar benefits, mostly just because of the hassle factor of doing so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Social Security&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are paying tithing on your Social Security and Medicare taxes, do you also plan to pay tithing on the benefits? I don’t. That’s not an increase; that’s just getting my money back. (Yes, I know the Social Security calculations are complex and you may be getting back more or less than you paid in, even when adjusting for the time value of money.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Insurance premiums and benefits&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s another dilemma when you start spending too much time thinking about tithing. In general, when you pay the premiums on an insurance policy with pre-tax dollars, the benefits are taxable. If you pay with post-tax dollars, the benefits are tax-free. If we’re only paying tithing on increase, that’s probably the way it ought to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So do you deduct your insurance premiums from your income before calculating tithing and then pay on any benefits received, or do you pay with post-tithing dollars and accept the benefits tithing-free? I’ve chosen to do the latter, mostly just because the accounting is easier!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Retirement accounts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I started earning money and using retirement accounts, I realized it would be crazy difficult to keep track of my tithing basis for contributions. So I decided to just plan to pay tithing when I take money out of retirement accounts like 401(k)s and Roth IRAs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look at it as deferred salary (even if it is a Roth account.) Contributions to those plans are basically tithing “deductions” on my tithing spreadsheet. I’ll pay on it when I take withdrawals from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Coverdell Education Savings Accounts and 529s&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a similar approach to education savings accounts. However, they bring in an additional complication. You’re only allowed to take out, at least tax and penalty free, an amount from the 529 or Coverdell as what was spent on legitimate educational expenses. There’s no allowance for an extra 10%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have not yet figured out how to deal with that other than the fact that I don’t plan to pay for every single dime of my children’s education using 529 money. So I should have the educational costs to pull a little more out of the account because the kid’s or my own earnings will be paying some of the cost. Or more likely, I can just make it up with other income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Health savings accounts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;These triple-tax-free accounts are pretty awesome. But they have the same issue as a 529: You can only make withdrawals tax and penalty free the same amount of money as you spend on health care. In other words, you can’t take out an extra 10% to pay tithing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it’s a small part of your income, no big deal. If you pull out $100,000 to pay for some crazy experimental medical treatment your insurance won’t cover, however, finding $10,000 to pay tithing with might be a little tougher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Capital gains and losses&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue with capital gains is that, especially for something you’ve owned for a long time, a large part of those capital gains are just inflation. That’s not really an increase at all. So I actually adjust my capital gains for inflation before calculating my tithing. I also subtract my capital losses from my income before calculating my tithing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owned a house for 20 years and it doubled in value? If inflation went up 50% in that time period, perhaps you should only pay tax on 25% of the house value. What about significant home improvements? Should they be added to your tithing basis just like they would to your tax basis for a rental property? Maybe they should, although I can’t say I’ve ever done that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Other random bits of increase&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about other stuff, like scholarships or grants? Or the fact that two-thirds of the cost of education at BYU is paid by tithing. Or that your degree at a state university is subsidized by your state? What about birthday gifts and Christmas presents? What if you don’t know what the present cost? What about credit card rewards points, free miles for signing up for a credit card, or a voucher given to you for missing your flight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t typically tithe on any of these things. It’s just too big of an accounting hassle. I think the Lord understands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The best way to pay tithing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best way to pay tithing is to donate appreciated shares from a taxable (non-qualified) account directly to the church. The “in-kind donations” office takes care of all that, and the church has an account at every major brokerage or mutual fund company that makes the share transfer easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of doing so is that you don’t have to pay capital gains taxes on those shares and neither does the church. But you still get to deduct the full value of the donation on Schedule A. Cool trick, eh? Of course, don’t forget to pay tithing on the inflation-adjusted increase in value of those shares!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How often to pay tithing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You visit with your bishop once a year for tithing settlement, so I see no reason to pay more than once a year. It makes for some really big tithing checks (unless I’ve donated shares that year) but it sure makes for easier bookkeeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just don’t raid that tithing fund for some other expense during the year. You might need that fire insurance! Of course, be sure to pay tithing on the interest earned by that money during the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Marginal tax + tithing rate&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your marginal tax rate is useful for determining all kinds of things. For example, at very high marginal tax rates many of us decide to work less. It just isn’t worth it when 46% of everything you earn goes to the government. For a Mormon, some of those decisions should be made by adding your tithing rate to your tax rate. Now 56% of the next dollar you earn goes somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, not entirely true, since you can probably deduct a good chunk of that tithing check against your taxes, so maybe it’s only 51%. But either way, Mormons, despite their Sunday school lessons on industry, service, and work, have more incentive than others to earn less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tithing can be complicated&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now you can see the wisdom in “it’s between you and God,” right? So as you come upon these decisions in your financial life, figure out what you would feel fine about if you were handing your check directly to God, and then don’t feel a bit bad declaring yourself a full tithe payer.

LeVar is well known for his role as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CpJpGF8lS8&quot;&gt;Kunta Kinte&lt;/a&gt;
in Roots and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7iHPjQRcu_0&quot;&gt;Lieutenant Commander Geordi La Forge&lt;/a&gt;
of the starship Enterprise.
But the role that brings everyone to their feet for a standing ovation is his work as host of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQfiWFwVF8M&quot;&gt;Reading Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know that the producers of Reading Rainbow sought LeVar out specifically for the role?
Did you know LeVar is a fierce advocate for children’s literacy? They had to have him.
LeVar is known for his roles on film and television yet he sees himself as a storyteller.
For the hour or so we spent with him he took us through his story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Power of Storytelling: Written – Spoken – Lived&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;All media is education. What are you teaching? The mission of Reading Rainbow is to provide books and other &lt;strong&gt;media that resonates with kids&lt;/strong&gt;.
These days kids want to be on their tablets. In the 80s it was their TV. While the message has not changed the medium has.
Reading Rainbow launched as a television series that aired from 1983 to 2009.
But LeVar’s vision for the message has moved to mobile, tablets, even VR and gaming.
There was even a nice reference to the holodeck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The old model of creating books from trees is not sustainable. He urges the audience to embrace digital media.
He speaks about the power of visual media and the power of video games.
Moving pictures and sounds can tell a story on multiple levels, conscious and unconscious.
Video games, he says, is where kids are going to absorb the myths of our culture.
He concludes, “I don’t want to read on the internet tonight that LeVar says we are getting rid of books.” The medium may change but the message is the same:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stories we tell inform who we are, why we’re here, and where we’re going. The stories we tell reveal what our contribution will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He talks about the emphasis on STEM. He advocates for us to update our thinking to STEAM: Science, Technology, Engineering, ARTS, and Math. He then ups the ante one more time introducing STREAM. The R is for . . . reading. You might say well of course reading. Reading is fundamental to the rest. That is the point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Reading is the fundamental to learning.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a young LeVar Burton, reading was a vehicle. His mother, Erma Jean Burton, was a voracious reader. She instilled this fundamental skill in him. Erma Jean had high expectations for her son: “I am the man that I am because she was the woman that she was.” She knew that as person of color LeVar faced grim realities. Reading empowered a young LeVar to face these realities. Reading gave him access to a story: “The story my mother told me. The story I embraced.” Reading empowered him with access to lifelong learning:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“A lifelong learner is a dangerous person indeed.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our human superpower is the ability to imagine ourselves in the past, alternate presents and future. There is an inextricable link between what we imagine and what we create. Stories shape our imagination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Tell Powerful Stories&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was really hoping to get some tips on writing more powerful stories.
I will say this.
Every sentence of his remarks could be a tweet. Very precise.
He told a series of stories from his life. Now when I think of a story, I think plot. His stories where character driven.
He talked about important people in his life and those people informed the story.
Three of those people he identified as storytelling mentors: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0M-yp0eORc&quot;&gt;Gene Roddenberry&lt;/a&gt;
, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIS_d9yJRdM&quot;&gt;Alex Haley&lt;/a&gt;
, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKy7ljRr0AA&quot;&gt;Fred Rodgers&lt;/a&gt;
.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Read, Ponder, Pray&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;He concluded with what I took as his version of the LDS mantra, read-ponder-pray:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Be still, stand in love, and pay attention. Love is the only sane response to the human experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But you don’t have to take my word for it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Happy Birthday!]]></title><description><![CDATA[

My birthday is the time to look ahead and ask myself, “What do I want my life to look like a year from now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my Birthday I saw this video about becoming more productive, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voCSkNjpVw0&quot;&gt;The Truth About Working Hard&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voCSkNjpVw0&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/voCSkNjpVw0/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Truth About Working Hard&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hours at the office doesn&amp;#x27;t count, #mindBlown. How often do you hear people talk about how much time they spend at the office?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, he is a salesman. He talks about sales-ish activities. My activities look different. The big one for me is write everyday AND more importantly publish on a regular basis (three times a week). With that in mind, let me ask you,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“What do you want your life to look like a year from now?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What activities will get you there? Let me know.

God knows the many times you have sought Him. The many times you have felt limitless joy. The many times you have wept in loneliness.

God still calls to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Savior extends His hand to you. And, as He did to those fishermen who stood long ago on the banks of the Sea of Galilee, with infinite love He speaks to you: “Come, follow me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you will hear Him, He will speak to you this very day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you walk the path of discipleship—when you move toward Heavenly Father—there is something within you that will confirm that you have heard the call of the Savior and set your heart toward the light. It will tell you that you are on the right path and that you are returning home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sublime message of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is that God is our Father, that He cares about us, and that there is a way to return to Him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/a-yearning-for-home?lang=eng%E2%80%8B&quot;&gt;A Yearning for Home&lt;/a&gt;. by Dieter F.

Often, when we look at ourselves, we see only our limitations and deficiencies. We might think we have to be “more” of something for God to use us—more intelligent, more wealthy, more charismatic, more talented, more spiritual. Blessings will come not so much because of your abilities but because of your choices. And the God of the universe will work within and through you, magnifying your humble efforts for His purposes.His work has always advanced on this important principle: “Out of small things proceedeth that which is great.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/a-yearning-for-home?lang=eng%E2%80%8B&quot;&gt;A Yearning for Home&lt;/a&gt;. by Dieter F.

Elder D. Todd Christofferson has taught, “A major reason the Lord has a church is to create a community of Saints that will sustain one another in the ‘strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life.’” He goes on to say, “This religion is not concerned only with self; rather, we are all called to serve. We are the eyes, hands, head, feet, and other members of the body of Christ.”Ask your Heavenly Father to show you those around you who need your help and to inspire you on how to best serve them. Heavenly Father may have placed those who need us closest to us, knowing that we are best suited to meet their needs. Remember that the Savior most often ministered to one person at a time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/the-needs-before-us?lang=eng&quot;&gt;The Needs Before&lt;/a&gt; Us Bonnie L.

As a story it is open to interpretation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I rediscovered this phrase the other day, “my truth”. Do people still say that? When I first heard it used, it was a way to enable sharing deeply held beliefs in a way that acknowledged and respected the deeply held beliefs of others. The phrase generally meant what is true for me based on my experience and understanding. It is valid and meaningful, but only for that person or for people who share that experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it seems to have become overused. The emphasis used to be on ‘my’. The emphasis seems to have migrated to ‘truth’ with the ‘my’ serving as an essentially silent placeholder to stifle any challenge or debate. You can’t label an opinion as ‘truth’ by putting a ‘my’ in front of it. The saying goes: there are three truths: your truth, my truth, and the actual truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. There are two. There is objective truth. These are what we call facts. Then there is subjective truth that is based on experience, context or opinion. The later has been substantiated, but is not objectively true in all situations. Objective truth is something that is true regardless of personal experience or opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facts have limited use. One is not more desirable than the other. It is only when we combine facts with experience or give them context that we get information that we can use: knowledge. That usually looks like a story. So while truth may be based on facts and real experiences those experience evolve. Context changes. Stories are inherently human. They share our imperfection. And that is ok.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Instincts. An inner guidance system.]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Some monarch butterfly populations migrate 3,000 miles (4,800 km) each year to climes better suited for their survival. Leatherback turtles travel across the Pacific Ocean from Indonesia to the coasts of California. Humpback whales swim from the cold waters of the North and South Poles toward the equator and back. Perhaps even more incredibly, the arctic tern flies from the Arctic Circle to Antarctica and back every year, some 60,000 miles (97,000 km).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When scientists study this fascinating behavior, they ask questions such as “How do they know where to go?” and “How does each successive generation learn this behavior?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I read of this powerful instinct in animals, I can’t help but wonder, “Is it possible that human beings have a similar yearning—an inner guidance system, if you will—that draws them to their heavenly home?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe that every man, woman, and child has felt the call of heaven at some point in his or her life. Deep within us is a longing to somehow reach past the veil and embrace Heavenly Parents we once knew and cherished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2017/10/a-yearning-for-home?lang=eng%E2%80%8B&quot;&gt;A Yearning for Home&lt;/a&gt;. by Dieter F.

It brings people together to celebrate the harvest, to look each other in the eye and share something magical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Gratitude, really?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gratitude is a virtue. Gratitude is a habit. It is the virtue that Job leaned on during challenging times in his life. Gratitude is a catalyst to all christlike attributes. A thankful heart is a parent of all virtues. Practicing gratitude allows you to experience more happiness, improve your mental health, and be more productive. It is a choice. It is not difficult. But it is easy not to do. You can choose to develop a habit of gratitude and gain the benefits. Or you can allow yourself to slip into negative thoughts, walking around muttering to yourself, “I hate my life.” Gratitude is a disposition. A way of life that stands independent of our current situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How does Gratitude Help You . . . At Work?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those who are happy experience 31% higher productivity, 37% higher sales, 3x greater creativity and 23% fewer fatigue symptoms. Happy people are also up to 10x more engaged, 40% more likely to receive a promotion, and 39% more likely to live to age 94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Master this one skill and you become invincible! When something bad happens in your life, look for three great things in your life. If you can learn how to position your mind in gratitude, things cannot hold you down. It’s impossible to take a grateful person and beat them down! It’s like a superpower. You can become invincible just by being grateful. As you build this muscle of gratitude, you’ll begin to even feel grateful for the hard times. The hard times make you tough. The hard times tear you down, so you can build a stronger you!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take Advantage of the 2-20 Rule.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shouldy Thinking. There are two forms of “Shouldy thinking”. Shouldy is a play on words: it sounds like sh*tty and is at the core the first type. If gratitude develops happiness, then entitlement develops depression. Entitlement is when you believe something should (shouldy) be happening that isn’t. You are not owed anything. Step out of expectation into genuine appreciation &amp;amp; gratitude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is not to say that there are not real injustices in the world that should be remedied. But let me ask you, would you be better prepared to tackle these injustices with a clear positive mind, or a crippled negative mind? This isn’t about the world and what everyone else does, this is about your inner place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second form of shouldy thinking is (are?) automatic negative thoughts. Or ANTs. Like real ants these just creep up on you. And there are more than one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did you know your brain is 2% of your body’s weight but consumes 20% of the calories you consume. This thanksgiving think about that. Seriously. One fifth, that is 400 calories, or a piece of pumpkin pie. What you eat affects what you think, that is the 2-20 rule.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a gratitude that heals the heart and expands the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What do I have to be grateful for when my world is falling apart?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can choose to limit our gratitude, based on the blessings we feel we lack. But those who set aside the bottle of bitterness and lift instead the goblet of gratitude can find a purifying drink of healing, peace, and understanding. It might sound contrary to the wisdom of the world to suggest that one who is burdened with sorrow should give thanks to God.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to be grateful for things when life seems to be going your way. But what do you do when what you wish for is far out of reach? It is difficult to develop a spirit of gratitude if our thankfulness is proportional to the number of blessings we can count. Instead of being thankful for your circumstances, focus on being thankful in your circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In times of distress expressing gratitude does not require you to also be pleased with your circumstance. It does not stop you from looking beyond present-day challenges and seeing through eyes of faith what can be. This is not a gratitude of the lips but of the soul. It is a gratitude that heals the heart and expands the mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Develop Gratitude with this ONE simple tool. And it’s FREE!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write down three new things that make you happy. Each day, see if you can rewire your brain’s for greater optimism and benefit from a boost of happiness. By actively finding ways to practice gratitude, joy and social connection, your brain will retain a pattern of scanning the world for the positive first rather than the negative. You can also use journaling time by recognizing negative thoughts (ANTs) and challenging their validity. Recognizing them for what they are is 70% of the battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are some common results you will experience by doing this simple gratitude journal. Many experience feeling calm, re-energized, and more ready to tackle the day; the ability to see things more clearly, feeling grounded, seeing opportunities rather than limitations; and the joy of spreading positivity to others.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;References &amp;amp; Additional Reading:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I straight up stole most of this blog from different sources that are greater than I.

Might as well get a PhD while I&amp;#x27;m at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still I&amp;#x27;ve been shopping for a Master&amp;#x27;s degree. A lot of companies offer some type of leadership development / mentoring. If you combined that with Corsera work I&amp;#x27;m sure I could match the curriculum of most MBA programs. I could create a more tailored program that would be preferable. Any program would have to include some type of social networking component. That is obviously not the same as a master&amp;#x27;s. But.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s look at the value gap between the two. Let&amp;#x27;s assume simple numbers. I make 50k and by getting a masters I expect to increase my earnings to 100k. Even if I finance my education, paying three times as much over time, It is a 90k investment over several years with a return of an additional 2.1 million in earnings over the course of my working life. So. No brainer right?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well. No. I know plenty of MBAs starting around 60k. If you invest the same 90k in education for and additional 10k a year then you will break even for ten years to pocket an additional 234k over your working life. Valuing the additional time and effort, I don&amp;#x27;t think it is worth it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Corsera there is considerably less risk. It&amp;#x27;s $50 a month (about $1800 for three years). Corsera offers less risk, but at a cost. The market values an MBA more than comparable course work. So all things equal an MBA candidate should win out over someone who completed coursework on Corsera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should. But.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is the argument that schools don&amp;#x27;t add value to employees. They are tools we use to signal employers. So if you have enough drive does it matter? I think it does. School will open doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also the marginal utility of additional earnings. Once you get over 76k the marginal utility of a dollar starts tapering off. Basically, you will have nicer stuff but you will not be any happier. More people are starting to realize that. Big house nice car is a dated value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My question. Is an MBA 16 times better than online coursework? It costs 16 times as much. No doubt it is better, but 16 times better?&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[On the Fallibility of Modern Prophets.]]></title><description><![CDATA[

It is not in the programme. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty. ~ Wilford Woodruff. President, LDS Church&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used to think this meant that the the leaders of the church were infallible: incapable of making a mistake or being wrong. It&amp;#x27;s easy to be snarky and point out that (of course) they are human, but to actually point something out as a mistake well that . . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt; sarcasm &amp;gt; . . . that&amp;#x27;s pretty much apostasy, right? At the very least it&amp;#x27;s a demonstrable lack of faith. &amp;lt; / sarcasm &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we be lead astray?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. Unequivocally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what does that mean? What does it mean to be lead astray? The work and glory of God is the immortality and eternal life of man (and woman). What doesn&amp;#x27;t it mean? It isn&amp;#x27;t . . . to be right. It isn&amp;#x27;t to be above reproach. It isn&amp;#x27;t freedom from embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did Joseph Smith doubt that he had been lead astray when he wrote, &amp;quot;O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Probably not. But if Joseph Smith could suffer torment, isolation, and martyrdom I think public embarrassment is within the scope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt; Opinion &amp;gt; The Lord will not risk the immortality and eternal life of his sheep, but he will not protect us from feeling sheepish. &amp;lt; / Opinion &amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;President Gordon B. Hinckley grapples with the fallibility of LDS leadership.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Hinkley experienced it in a way few ever have or will. Elder Gordon B. Hinckley was called as a third Counselor to the First Presidency on July 23 1981, when President Spencer W. Kimball as well as his two counselors were unable to attend to all their duties. By 1984, Hinckley was the only publicly active member of the First Presidency. After Kimball&amp;#x27;s death, Ezra Taft Benson became President of the Church. Benson named Hinckley his first counselor and Thomas Monson his second. In the early 1990s, Benson developed serious health problems, removing him from public view. Hinckley and Monson carried out many of the duties of the First Presidency until Benson died in 1994. After Benson’s death, Howard W. Hunter became President and retained Hinckley and Monson as counselors in the First Presidency. Hunter died nine months later. At this point in 1995, Hinckley assumed the mantle of Prophet. Hinkley knew the limits of those called to the presidency better than most. His thoughts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have worked with the Presidents of the Church from President Heber J. Grant onward. … I have known [their] counselors, and I have known the Council of the Twelve during [these] years. All of these men have been human. They have had human traits and perhaps some human weaknesses. But over and above all of that, there has been in the life of every one of them an overpowering manifestation of the inspiration of God. Those who have been Presidents have been prophets in a very real way. I have intimately witnessed the spirit of revelation upon them. The Lord refined and polished each one, let him know discouragement and failure, let him experience illness and in some cases deep sorrow. All of this became part of a great refining process, and the effect of that process became beautifully evident in their lives. ~ Gordon B Hinckley, President, LDS Church&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;From the life of President Monson.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;2015 October Conference. President Monson is concluding his thoughts when his strength began to fail putting him at risk of a fall. Why doesn&amp;#x27;t someone help him? With the lights dimmed, very few can see the whole picture as the prophet concludes his remarks. Michelle Cope was there. Her story is a great example of how the Lord carries us at times. She gives the following account:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of you probably did not see what was happening behind President Monson at the end of his talk. I was on the floor, just a few rows from the very front of the Conference Center with a clear view of the scene. You might have noticed that President Monson really struggled to finish the last couple minutes of his talk and especially the last 30 seconds. I was afraid for him. I thought he might faint, pass out, or something worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then, my heart melted when I saw behind President Monson was President Uchtdorf – on the edge of his seat, almost half-way standing up, with his arms stretched out, ready to catch the Prophet at any moment if he fell. You could see the worried expression on President Uchtdorf’s face as well as focused determination. He was on high alert and ready to catch him. As soon as President Monson said “Amen”, President Uchtdorf was immediately at his side and carried him back to his seat, safe and sound.~ Michelle Cope&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Monson teaches us, both in word and example, when we are on the Lord’s errand, He promises, “I will be on your right hand and on your left, and my Spirit shall be in your hearts, and mine angels round about you, to bear you up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When your life is difficult, when affliction leaves you wobbling and short of breath, don’t worry if no one is by your side, because He has your back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having the answers is not the mark of faith. It is only by asking questions that we gain our own greater understanding.*** I find these stories from the lives of two presidents build my faith in the leadership of the church as well as in myself. It is on you to work out your own salvation. The Lord will not put our salvation at risk but, you might by holding an expectation of infallibility in our leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;*** Answers are not necessarily included.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Biannual Bibliothon 2017 Blogger Book Tag]]></title><description><![CDATA[

And here is another post that is going to appear to miss the mark, at least on the surface. I say that because team work (i hate to use the term management, but if i don’t it will not be clear that i am talking about leadership in management) is about building teams as much as it is about getting work done. You can’t do that with rose colored glasses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2017/04/songs-sung-and-unsung?lang=eng&quot;&gt;Elder Holland spoke&lt;/a&gt; during the Saturday afternoon session of conference.

Is there is such a thing as an alternative fact? Aren’t facts by definition true? If proven false then don’t they cease to be . . . fact?
]]></description><link>https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/my-journey/alternative-facts</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/my-journey/alternative-facts</guid><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jan 2017 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Is there is such a thing as an alternative fact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aren’t facts by definition true?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If proven false then don’t they cease to be . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fact?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the land before the internet I enjoyed court room dramas. Inevitably the prosecution and the defense would take turns interviewing their experts who would present competing evidence. With the internet it is possible for any debate to become a courtroom drama. You can find evidence, facts, and experts that support any believe or opinion. Now for the matter at hand I don’t care if Trump had more attendees or not. My first thought when I see a headline like that is that there isn’t much going on at the moment, (but they have to report on something). I don’t think crowd size at the inauguration is blog-worthy, let alone a press conference, but I believe what has happened here is a microcosm of the larger drama between the Trump Administration and the media. That is worth taking a closer look at.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s worth paying attention because in this case we have access to all the facts. That will not always be the case. We can look at the facts and draw our own conclusion. Kellyanne Conway believes this incident is a “symbol for the unfair and incomplete treatment that this President often receives.” Is that what is happening here? Or do we have, as the Media tells it, a situation where government is brow beating reporters for telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recode does a fair job of covering the issue but there are some other sources I want to reference. It started with the Times reporting that fewer people attended President Trump’s inauguration than President Obama’s in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/inauguration.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;peak_obama_from_wash-monpeak-trump-from-wash-mon&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Times reports the images were both captured 45 minutes before the oath of office. The Times’ expert, Keith Still, estimates that the crowd on the National Mall on Friday was about one-third the size of Mr. Obama’s. He is a professor at Manchester Metropolitan University in England and a crowd safety consultant. He has consulted for the 2011 royal wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, as well as the Saudi government on crowds for the hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I tuned in about 10 min before noon. There were performances and prayers just before the swearing in of Vice President Pence. According to the Times attendees were still entering the National Mall up until Mr. Trump’s speech. Better late then never. That is like showing up to a movie for the last 15 min. There obviously was room for them. Fox news provides some additional facts that support the Times’ narrative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Spicer entered the debate. I find it odd that the White House held a special press conference on Saturday ahead of the first scheduled conference on Monday to address the matter. He made five points to refute the Times:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was the first time in our nation’s history that floor coverings have been used to protect the grass on the Mall. That had the effect of highlighting any areas where people were not standing, while in years past the grass eliminated this visual.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“All of this space from Trump’s platform to the Washington Monument was full when the president took the Oath of Office.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We know that 420,000 people used the D.C. Metro public transit yesterday, which actually compares to 317,000 that used it for President Obama’s last inaugural.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration — period — both in person and around the globe.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;“This was also the first time that fencing and magnetometers went as far back on the Mall, preventing hundreds of thousands of people from being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had in inaugurations past.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these points have been proven false. I have the same question Chuck Todd asks Kellyanne Conway in the clip below,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why send Spicer to the podium to litigate a provable falsehood? Mind you about the smallest, pettiest thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods,” Chuck Todd tells Pres. Trump’s counselor Kellyanne Conway this morning. ~ &lt;a href=&quot;pic.twitter.com/Ao005dQ13r&quot;&gt;Meet the Press (@MeetThePress) January 22, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kellyanne makes a great point, “Presidents are not judged by crowd sizes, they are judged by their accomplishments.” She follows up with the statement,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I am about things that are quantifiable and important.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Trump Administration’s actions tell a different story. Is she avoiding the question?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is there is such a thing as an alternative fact? Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods. I want to make the argument that we should consider and even seek out facts that contradict our opinions and beliefs. We don’t need to rename them. They are simply fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If proven false they cease to be . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;fact.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Trumps Win Can Not Be Undone, For Me, It’s Become Personal]]></title><description><![CDATA[

And the wise man is silent. If I say something that resonates with you please let me know. Dialog gives us an opportunity to grow, #WisdomThruRespect . My name is Rho. I am not a speaker. I am a thinker. I do my best thinking in Excel. I’m a data nerd. I am the principal contributor to Assume Wisely, a blog about making decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I believe my experience can be of help as you seek to heal, and heal frayed relationships. In the early hours of election day I seriously considered voting for Trump, I am not politically offended: I understand &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/deny270&quot;&gt;where republicans are coming from&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still hurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I put his character aside, just as I put hers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still hurts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was able to excuse a man who is accustomed to having his way with people. Now he has had his way with the american people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It still hurts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Something else is happening. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started my morning routine at 4 am on Wednesday like it was any other day. In the wake of Trump’s win the Dow dropped during overnight trading. I was looking for bargains in the market. It is important for me to highlight where my mind was because something had changed and I was not aware.  I had not consumed any media. This wasn’t political upset. This wasn’t the pain of loosing. This wasn’t sadness. This wasn’t mourning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was visceral pain. This was fear. It wasn’t until I am getting off the bus that I realize I am feeling uncomfortable. Three things stand out this morning:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;all the faces on the bus are white.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the lavish breakfast spread out for a meeting I&amp;#x27;m not invited to&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the admission of a friend that voted Trump&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Somehow each of these pointed to one singular conclusion. It is important to not let emotions control your decisions, but you should never ignore them. My emotions are hijacked with a sense that . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . .  I do not belong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve come to know this feeling well. I feel a sense of accomplishment that I’ve been able to dismiss this feeling. But it still hangs around in the shadows. This week, it stepped out of the shadows. Have I been kidding myself all along? Now I ask, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;do i belong?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Did i ever? My friend assures me he isn’t racist. He says,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“ My heart goes out to those who are in pain or feel our country has turned its back on them. I hope my thoughts may help clear up some of those inaccuracies so heads can be raised, hope rekindled, friends reunited, and we can move forward as one. I hope you can better understand that I (and most of the 60 million of us) didn’t vote for him out of hatred toward you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve had several friends justify themselves on Facebook.  They insist they are not racists. In the days leading up to the election I adopted the words of a gay Trump supporter,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Voters do not pull a lever to endorse a candidate’s flaws.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is still true. But It doesn’t invalidate that I have been wounded. It was not intentional, it was not anticipated. I am equally surprised.  It is nonetheless a wound. I need time to heal. I need to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How Can I Move Forward?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here in Utah, I am getting involved in politics for the first time. Regardless of who you support, I invite you to walk with me. Subscribe below and we can walk together. The path forward is not clear. Here are some first steps we can take:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Get clear on your values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Attend and participate in community meetings.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Volunteer with your party.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work on a campaign.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Wear a safety pin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s a growing effort in the United States for people to start wearing a safety pin in the face of attacks and harassment. It is literally a safety pin.  One small way to signal that you’re an ally (regardless of who you voted for) to anyone who feels so out of place in this volatile time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The “safety pin” symbol was inspired by the 2014 #illridewithyou movement in Sydney, Australia. People offered to sit next to Muslims who felt threatened on their commutes — at the time, in the aftermath of a terrorist attack, they feared an Islamophobic backlash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For those that subscribe below I will be creating a community with content, links, and tips for those who are walking this path for the first time. Involvement is more than voting. Involvement is more than knowing about the Utah caucus system. Involvement is a weekly if not monthly engagement. This is a first for me too.

What happened? We nominated a “&lt;a href=&quot;http://media.mtvnservices.com/embed/mgid:arc:video:comedycentral.com:3b7e4684-ed01-11e0-aca6-0026b9414f30&quot;&gt;crazy third world dictator.&lt;/a&gt;” It’s a terrible joke.

It is a vote for principles. Trump has an established pattern of behavior. He isn’t sorry. He hasn’t changed. He believes he can do anything. He disrespects women as he does the party. But Trump is the star so you will “let him do anything”. I get that YOU need to vote for Trump. To win or at least not give in. Because you have put party before principle. Respect yourself, “If this is the best our party gets &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Kbryz0mxuMY?t=2m58s&quot;&gt;then our party should quit&lt;/a&gt;.” Celebrity is a value, but it isn’t one I share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Misdirected Voter Values&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d like to think I can appreciate where Trump votes are coming from. Peter Thiel is a contrarian and supports Trump for president. Thiel is a tech investor most notable for founding Paypal among other name brand tech startups. While the New York Times labeled him toxic, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg defended him saying, “It would set a bad precedent to cut ties with him because of his political views.” In &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/ob-LJqPQEJ4?t=2m44s&quot;&gt;a speach to the National Press Club&lt;/a&gt;, #NPCLive , Thiel makes several good points:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voters do not pull a lever to endorse a candidates flaws.&lt;/strong&gt; While this election may appear crazy, it’s less crazy then the condition of our country. It’s not a lack of judgement that leads Americans to vote for Trump. Both major candidates are imperfect people to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Median income&lt;/strong&gt; is lower than it was 17 years ago. Fact check: While that is true, it is comparing now to a time in the economy just before the tech bubble of 2000 burst. It was a time of excess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Student Loan Debt&lt;/strong&gt; This is the only country where students take on loans they will never escape, even by filing bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government is the problem.&lt;/strong&gt; We judge the leadership of our country to have failed. It isn’t surprising to see people vote for Bernie Sanders, or Donald Trump, who is now the only outsider left in the race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thiel identifies a call for new american politics that overcomes denial, rejects bubble thinking, &amp;amp; recons with reality. He suggests that if we fail to elect Trump we may ask, “Did the new american politics come too late?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse the strengths of Thain’s oratory with Trump’s strengths. Agree or disagree, Thain is persuasive. He knows his audience: Bernie supporters. I don’t even know if Mcmullan is on his radar. He frames Trump with Bernie. Trump is the last independent candidate. This point has two benefits (1) it speaks directly across the isle to fringe democrats that supported Bernie, (2) it gives Trump supporters something to share with friends and family. He also does a great job of identifying a widely held pain: that Washington is fundamentally broken and that only an outsider can fix it. The flaw in Thain’s argument is the suggestion that Trump is the answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trumps Plan for America Looks Like A High School Assignment&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I googled, “trump plan for America”. To be fair I also googled, “Hillary plan for america”. Trumps big plans are shockingly immature. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that the opportunity to attend a two or four-year college, or to pursue a trade or a skill set through vocational and technical education, will be easier to access, pay for, and finish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is it. The whole thing looks like is was formatted by a high school student in MS Word. It reads like a vague job responsibility. It is woefully inadequate. It is confirmation of the criticism that he is all buzz and little substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In comparison Hillary’s blog is an inspiration. Literally, the design inspired me to be a better blogger. Visually it is beautiful. I don’t have any issues with Hillary. I have issues with the system. She is a product of that system. She embodies the problems. But she isn’t the problem, they are systemic. She can’t be the change we need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;We Need To Be The Outsider.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with Thain whole-heartedly in his call for a new american politics. Hillary cannot fix the problems. Trump cannot fix them either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enter McMullin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mcmullin cannot fix them either. We need to stop waiting on others to fix our problems. We need to stop holding our nose while we wait to see what our parties bring us. That starts with acknowledging our mistake. Republicans have messed up. Instead of acknowledging this they are toeing that party line and pointing the finger at Hillary. That isn’t acceptable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So on November 14th when this is old news. I will reach out to my local leadership. I will volunteer. I will learn from my mistakes. I will humbly begin the process of learning to actively participate in the political process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Join me.

To confuse them is to literally confuse a thoughtful response with failing to respond.

This is the appearance of piety, the face of righteousness, and too often is financed with resentment. It’s a loan with unfavorable terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t confuse “not speaking up for yourself or others” as meekness. You can speak up without fighting &amp;amp; arguing. These are techniques. Reaction is not the only option, you can choose how to respond. Selectivity of technique is not the same as failure to speak up. To confuse them is to literally confuse a thoughtful response with failing to respond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking up the definition of meek was helpful. I prefer the “&lt;a href=&quot;http://wordcentral.com/cgi-bin/student?book=Student&amp;amp;va=meek&quot;&gt;defined for kids&lt;/a&gt;” because it is straightforward, but the third is from &lt;a href=&quot;http://merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meek&quot;&gt;Merriam Webster&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1: Putting up with wrongs patiently and without complaint (&amp;amp; resentment): MILD
2: Lacking spirit or self-assurance: HUMBLE
3: Having or showing a quiet and gentle nature: not wanting to fight or argue with other people&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reference&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.deseret.com/2016/7/23/20592522/my-view-more-whites-should-practice-meekness-in-race-relations-struggle&quot;&gt;My view: More whites should practice meekness in race-relations struggle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Two Facts I wish I knew when I was Just diagnosed with Papillary Thyroid Cancer.]]></title><description><![CDATA[
My Dr. referred me to Dr. Amad two years ago, when I was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He ordered the PET scan. I asked why. His response chilled me: “Because I can’t look at your lungs with a sonogram.”
]]></description><link>https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/my-journey/diagnosed-with-cancer-part-2</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/my-journey/diagnosed-with-cancer-part-2</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Mar 2016 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;January 2016. It was curious that my endocrinologist, Dr. Amad, ordered a PET scan. Biopsy is a scary word the first time around, but not the second. Dr Amad took a couple of biopsies of lymph nodes in my neck. He said these could possibly explain the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thyca.org/pap-fol/more/thyroglobulin&quot;&gt;rise in my Thyroglobulin&lt;/a&gt;, but he wasn’t convinced. My Dr. referred me to Dr. Amad two years ago, when I was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer. He ordered the PET scan. I asked why. His response chilled me: “Because I can’t look at your lungs with a sonogram.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fact 1. Being diagnosed with thyroid cancer actually puts you at higher risk for other cancer.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn’t ask, “Why do you want to look at my lungs?” The answer was obvious. One cancer diagnosis didn’t mean I couldn’t have another. Can thyroid cancer spread to the lungs? I learned a thyroid cancer diagnosis actually puts you at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thyroid.org/patient-thyroid-information/ct-for-patients/vol-7-issue-4/vol-7-issue-4-p-3-4&quot;&gt;a 33% higher risk for other cancers&lt;/a&gt;. The PET scan revealed a 2 cm nodule nestled between my trachea, lung, and a major artery. I was diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer in 2014. I could still have undiagnosed follicular thyroid cancer, which spreads to the lungs. Three different doctors recommended surgery to remove the mass.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Fact 2. Food for thought on holistic cancer treatment: Studies show that eating a diet consisting of 20% animal protein contributes to cancer growth.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 2016. While  preparing for surgery, I came across some food for thought on holistic cancer treatment, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1937856755&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aschinastudy-20&amp;amp;linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5&quot;&gt;The China Study&lt;/a&gt;. An experiment was originally conducted in 1968 by a pair of Indian scientists, TV Madhavan, &amp;amp; C. Gopalan: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19721301150.html&quot;&gt;The effect of dietary protein on carcinogenesis of aflatoxin&lt;/a&gt;. Campbell built on their original experiment, replicating their results. Campbell showed that a 20% protein diet promotes cancer growth while a 5% protein diet shut it down. Campbell went on on to participate as a member of the China Study team. Praise for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1937856755&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aschinastudy-20&amp;amp;linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5&quot;&gt;The China Study&lt;/a&gt; is impressive:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The China Study describes a monumental survey of diet and death rates from cancer in more than 2,400 Chinese counties and the equally monumental efforts to explore its significance and implications for nutrition and health.”~ Frank Rhodes, PhD President Emeritus, Cornell University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The China Study is the most convincing evidence yet on preventing heart disease, cancer, and other Western diseases by dietary means. ~ Junshi Chen MD, PhD Senior Research Professor, Institute of Nutrition and Food Safety – Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The China Study is a well-documented analysis of the fallacies of the modern diet, lifestyle and medicine and the quick fix approach that often fails. The lessons from China provide compelling rationale for a plant based diet to promote health and reduce the risk of the diseases of affluence. ~ Sushma Palmer, PhD Former Executive Director, Food &amp;amp; Nutrition Board – U.S. National Academy of Sciences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This research gives me food for thought. There is complexity to eating that extends beyond nutrition. I don’t pretend to understand that complexity. There is a social side, illustrated by this quote from Samuel L Jackson:  “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0010673/quotes&quot;&gt;How can I trust a man who won’t eat a good old-fashioned American hotdog?&lt;/a&gt;” There is a emotional side. We use food as a drug. We use foods to treat ourselves; we treat ourselves to ice cream. Thoracic surgery provided me some clarity, I don’t want to do that again. For now, I’ll have that hotdog, but I don’t need one every day. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937856755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1937856755&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=aschinastudy-20&amp;amp;linkId=T3FXOUAKN7ZULFP5&quot;&gt;I bought The China Study&lt;/a&gt;. I’m reading it now.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Revile Mediocrity]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The dealership is closed. I stopped by on my way home from the office, I&amp;#x27;m alone with my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If you watched a movie about a guy who wants a Volvo and worked for years to get it, you wouldn’t cry at the end when he drove off the lot. . . &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wouldn’t tell your friends. . . Or go home listen to some music and ponder the lessons of the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is, you wouldn’t remember that movie a week later. . . Nobody cries at the end of a movie about a guy who wants a Volvo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we spend our years actually living those stories, and expect our lives to feel meaningful. . . if, what we choose to do with our lives won’t make a story meaningful, it won’t make a life meaningful either.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;~ Donald Miller, A Million Miles in a Thousand Years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-KHWUq3B7I&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/h-KHWUq3B7I/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The life of an Entreprenuer in 90 seconds.&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is the Volvo the issue? What if it was a Challenger Hellcat? A Tesla? I believe that meaning isn&amp;#x27;t found in owning a car. But Patrick Bet-David counters that idea in less than 2 minutes. He uses a sports car as a symbol that speaks to success. Patrick says most people only pay attention to the finished product. Most people focus on the car. Donald Miller is guilty of focusing on the car. Losers focus on winners and what winners drive. Winners focus on winning. In the end, your success will speak for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with focus. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I want to chat]]></title><description><![CDATA[
