10,000 hours is five years at a full time job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No doubt on pursuing continuous improvement as a lifelong endeavor. But along the way let&amp;#x27;s knock out competent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Competence takes 20 hours. And knowing that little nugget makes it much more realizable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5MgBikgcWnY&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/5MgBikgcWnY/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The First 20 Hours -- How to Learn Anything&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You don’t have 10,000 hours to learn something new. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am never going to have free time ever again.&amp;quot; I wrote that on about month two of being a new parent. I love learning. The more I learn, the more I need to learn. The more books I read, the more books I need to read. And so my conflict came to a head. Where am I going to find the time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we’ve all heard that it takes 10,000 hours to acquire a new skill. If you want to be good, 10k hours. That&amp;#x27;s the same as working a full time job for five years. That&amp;#x27;s a lot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the research that determined that bar of 10,000 hours is based on the goal to become world-class, like a gold medal Olympian. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No doubt pursuing continuous improvement is a lifelong endeavor. But along the way I think i&amp;#x27;ll knock out competent. And for some things competent is good enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;H/T to Josh Kaufman for his book &amp;quot;The First 20 Hours&amp;quot; as well as this YouTube video.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Modern Values Based Leadership]]></title><description><![CDATA[
When values are clear it creates trust. It creates a common ground you can build on. It builds the foundation of a relationship.

It&amp;#x27;s saturday afternoon, I’m unloading groceries. I don&amp;#x27;t remember what set me off, I just remember chucking a giant Costco package of toilet paper across my lawn in the general direction of my front door. I&amp;#x27;d had it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was tired. Tired of being broke. Tired of all the crap in my life. Too much nagging. Not enough sex. Too much weight. Not enough exercise. Too much work. Not enough results. Too much month at the end of the money. And my kids...my only reason to endure, were killing me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dreaded the weekend. Another reminder of how much my life sucked. At least when I went to work, I could focus on work and take my mind off things. Monday mornings were the worst: the inevitable question, what did I do over the weekend? The truth is, I spent my weekends simmering, waiting for Monday because we were broke. I couldn&amp;#x27;t afford to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife&amp;#x27;s had it too. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s never enough,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re never happy.&amp;quot; My wife is tired. Tired of seeing me like this. She is right of course. I keep repeating the same line: the idea that when I graduate college, get my first job, get a new job, make a certain amount of money . . . then I&amp;#x27;ll be happy. But that isn&amp;#x27;t true at all! I keep moving the goalposts because each step doesn&amp;#x27;t make me happier, it just frustrates me more that I am not where I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;#x27;t know it but I was suffering from shouldy values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Hole We All Need to Climb Out Of&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shouldy values is what I call our default setting: focusing on what should be, what I should have had by now. There is one in particular: Big house. Nice car. I didn&amp;#x27;t even want that big a house, just bigger. I didn&amp;#x27;t even want that nice a car, just nicer. In the absence of actual values those shouldy values end up as a fairly common default:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? Tour bus, studio, and the fans, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? To feed my family and my friends,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? To change your world the best I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEk_XPY1sSg&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s It All For&lt;/a&gt;, Bazaar Royal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowledging these shouldy values is the important first step. It isn&amp;#x27;t the same as discovering the valuable ones. How is this discovery achieved? For me it was &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/values-2015&quot;&gt;a long process&lt;/a&gt; of figuring things out as I went along. It&amp;#x27;s not learning something new; It&amp;#x27;s simply remembering what you already know.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering values is an art. It&amp;#x27;s creative expression. It isn&amp;#x27;t additive, like molding clay. It&amp;#x27;s subtractive, like carving into stone. You&amp;#x27;re looking to unearth something under the surface that&amp;#x27;s been there all along. Don&amp;#x27;t try to create new values; all you can truly do is expose the real ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Transformative Power of Strong Company Values&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A community that can clearly identify its values emits an attractive force. Values are inherently fuzzy. We&amp;#x27;re all seeking them in some form. It&amp;#x27;s natural to want to participate in something larger than yourself. Such a community pulls you in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is matter of course in religious communities where values are taught as part of the tenets of faith. By no means is it exclusive to religious organizations. When I wasn&amp;#x27;t simmering on the weekends, I worked at Entrata. Entrata is exceptional in living its values. Entrata is a fun place to work. It’s one of the company values: business in the front, party in the back. We worked hard, we played hard. It was easy to adopt Entrata’s values as my own. It was easy to resonate with them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When values are clear it creates trust. It creates a common ground you can build on. It builds the foundation of a relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrata modeled for me how to live intentionally and not by default. I needed to see that. It gave me permission to do likewise. It prodded me to discover my own values. To turn the default setting off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Mistake That Is Costing You&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at your resume. Where is the emphasis? Is it on your accomplishments? Take a look at what you wrote in your last performance evaluation. Do you concentrate on your actions? Consider the last excellent movie you saw. What can you tell me about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t give away the plot! Focusing on the &amp;#x27;what&amp;#x27; is a temptation everyone falls prey to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, start with &amp;quot;Why.&amp;quot; Simon Sinek wrote a book on it, but you can get away with just watching his TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/start_with_why_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;Start With Why&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone (and everyone) can tell you what they do.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some can talk about how. This is 90% of what marketers will focus on: differentiating value proposition, proprietary process, secret sauce, or USP.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few discuss the importance of Why, Purpose, Cause, Belief. These are crucial to consider. Why do you wake up every day? More importantly, why should anyone care? People don&amp;#x27;t buy what you do--they buy why you do it. Your product simply serves as proof of what you believe.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. It is not making money; that is a result.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with Why, then follow it up with How and What.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Start with Why&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3Tmc3HF&quot;&gt;Start With Why&lt;/a&gt; hoping to learn how. The book comes up short on teaching how. The book focuses on why it matters and at the end, Simon upsells his $100 course to help you find your why. I opted to figure it out on my own. It took a little over a year to nail down a repeatable process. But it was free! If you are interested in learning how I did it, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tough to figure out your Why. It&amp;#x27;s innately fuzzy and &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/values-2015&quot;&gt;hard to pin down&lt;/a&gt;. Your goal is to bring it into sharp focus. That might take some time. Keep revisiting the idea, and you&amp;#x27;ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My initial efforts were strongly influenced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3KqROVx&quot;&gt;Strengths Finder 2.0 Assessment&lt;/a&gt;. I strongly recommend this assessment; it&amp;#x27;s free when you buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3KqROVx&quot;&gt;Strengths Finder 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. This is a fantastic tool for determining your natural talents to set you apart from the crowd. Strengths are your USP, your secret sauce. This task is well worth your time. Even as I studied my talents I was keenly aware that I was missing the mark. Strengths speak to your How not your Why. Strengths aren&amp;#x27;t the same as purpose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s ironic that the question Simon Sinek leaves unanswered in his TED talk is answered by another TED talk: How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes by Adam Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/life_purpose_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;elevator pitch&amp;quot; is something you&amp;#x27;re undoubtedly familiar with. Adam goes through a series of questions to help you articulate yours in under five minutes: your own elevator pitch that starts with why. You can check out mine on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rholall/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn Profile&lt;/a&gt;. Or my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/rho_lall/&quot;&gt;Instagram Bio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is starting with Why. This is real progress. This is material accomplishment. This is . . . not enough. This is not going to weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Make no mistake the storm comes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Cure For Shouldy Values&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This excecise will help you identify those values that will weather the storms. You are going to fill out &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a bracket for your values&lt;/a&gt;. Think March Madness, but with values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is most easily done using Post-It notes. I&amp;#x27;ve started you off with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a pretty good list of values&lt;/a&gt;. Look for ideas in this list, or simply google &amp;quot;list of values.&amp;quot; On a post-it notes, write down the values that appeal to you. One value per Post-It. If a term attracts your attention, note it down on a post-it. Don&amp;#x27;t edit yourself at this step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create these five categories: relationships, things, talents, traits, and skills. You should already have a stack of Post-it notes on hand. Sort your notes into these categories. Don&amp;#x27;t overlook this step. I had to start over. In the last step, it will become obvious why this is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, fill out your bracket. Hold a tournament for each category (think March Madness). Each value will compete against another. Consider a pair of values. If you have to pick one, which do you keep? The winner advances. Repeat until there is a clear winner for each category. You can repeat the process to determine second place and so on until your values are ranked for each category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The categories are crucial because you might prioritize one category over another. This was my experience: even though I highly value knowledge, values in other categories killed it off simply because knowledge is a thing. I value things the least. I realized the need for categories when I saw knowledge dropping deep down in the ranking. Play with it, flex the bracket to meet your needs. The bracket is designed to spark your own intuition. It&amp;#x27;s not intended as an objective measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Knowing Your Values Can Help You With Tough Decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I have a disagreement we have a few options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concede. My go-to. For most things, it just doesn&amp;#x27;t matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persist. Endure. Bully. Until the other person concedes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compromise. No one gets what they want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage our common values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can choose the last option to take a step back. Remember who we are and what we value. Elevate the discussion to a higher plane. Approach our discussion from a position of common ground. Ask, &amp;quot;What do people like us who hold these values do in this situation?&amp;quot; Leverage our values to make the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Values are a tool of effective leadership.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a world where the only certainty is change, values-based leadership is more important than ever. In order to navigate through the constant uncertainty and chaos, organizations need leaders who can make decisions based on enduring values, not short-term pivots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/where_have_all_the_good_men_gone.png&quot; alt=&quot;Where Have All the Good Men Gone&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a values-based leader in the modern age? What do values do for an organization? And how you can use them to navigate the challenges of modern business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Values afford leaders the leverage they need so they don&amp;#x27;t have to be present in every meeting (and for every decision). Values create leverage for thinking and decision-making. It&amp;#x27;s important to recognize the role values play in leadership and decision-making. What do I mean?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a business context values become a tool. Values are the foundational data your tribe has available to make informed decisions. They are the fundamental building block that drives everything else in the org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Developing Company Values&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrata continuously invests in its values, it&amp;#x27;s not a one-time thing. It starts with interviews--my friend told me that they would ask about the company&amp;#x27;s values. They did. Every week, we encouraged each other to live up to these values. &amp;quot;Talk to me Goose&amp;quot;, TTMG, was a common shorthand for communication as was &amp;quot;Be Excellent&amp;quot; to .... our customers ... each other, etc. Values were on display at Values Week as well as other company events. Each year during our annual review, we addressed how well we lived up to the Entrata values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said before Entrata is a fun place to work: business in the front, party in the back. The symbol of that particular value is the mullet. At Entrata the conference rooms are named after famous mullets: there is Aggassi, Norris, Bolton, and Cyrus just to name a few. Walk into Norris and the large display monitor has a screensaver featuring . . . Chuck Norris. That&amp;#x27;s cool. That&amp;#x27;s fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to Purple Innovation I see a similar theme to our conference rooms. Instead of famous mullets, Purple&amp;#x27;s conference rooms are named after scientists: Da Vinci, Tesla, Edison. It&amp;#x27;s not listed as one of our values, but &amp;quot;Thanks Science!&amp;quot; is a popular phrase Purple uses for swag and social media. Science isn&amp;#x27;t expressly stated in our current values; it underlies several of them. As a data professional, that is attractive. I believe in science, I invest in knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tell Me Your Story.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders provide stability in an unstable environment and inspire teams to achieve great things. Embrace values-based leadership to create a culture of trust in your organization, your tribe, from employees to shareholders, better decision-making, greater creativity, and innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all forget. We all need to be reminded of our purpose. Jamie Dimon once said,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Leadership is relentless storytelling.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell me your story. Do the work, what story is yours to tell? It&amp;#x27;s a story about you, your tribe, and what you do for them. It starts with what you believe, and what you value. But it can&amp;#x27;t just be about you. Your story is about what you do to help your tribe reach their ideal, achieve their goals, and overcome their trials. You need to be clear about who you are, what you believe, and how you stand out. You need to be clear so you can communicate with your tribe. How else will they know? When you share your values it will resonate with them. They will be better for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is your contribution, what you do to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;PS: Memory Lane&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#x27;t do this with all my blogs but this one is hard won and special to me. To help illustrate the time investment I&amp;#x27;m listing out the previous itterations this idea has gone through over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;2022: &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/values-2022&quot;&gt;Values Based Leadership For The Modern Age&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2017: &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/values-2017&quot;&gt;How Great Leaders Inspire Action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;2015: &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/values-2015&quot;&gt;Think Into the Deep Thought&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Data Warehousing for Dummies Series: An ETL Pimer for Business]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Back, when ETL was all I did, my team didn&amp;#x27;t even call it that. Mostly because we used Excel. I was self conscious about my lack of experience with SQL. I would say, “I move data from one place to another.” And that would get a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was a very manual process which I ultimately automated with Python. Most of it. From that experience I gained a deep understanding of data and how it connects together. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s funny is that what we call ETL today isn’t ETL either. But the name has stuck. And we all know what we mean by it. But if you don’t know, it’s hard to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ya know?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are reading this you already know the value of timely decisions and pivoting on the data. But the task of consolidating and analyzing data from various sources is daunting. There are a lot of moving parts. The first is getting the data. In this blog post, I am going to break down ETL; how data gets from out there into your data warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Who this is for&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a business owner or leader:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is the new currency of business. When you invest in a data warehouse you need to fill it. ELT tools help you do that. These tools leverage automation. Use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You likely don’t want the detail I am about to go into. I created my &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/data-warehousing-for-dummies-pdf&quot;&gt;data warehousing for dummies PDF&lt;/a&gt; with you in mind. There are two parts, the first is the executive summary and it is written with you in mind. You can get that here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You are a data analyst, data scientist, but new to data warehousing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are looking for a place to get started. There are two parts to my &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/data-warehousing-for-dummies-pdf&quot;&gt;data warehousing for dummies PDF&lt;/a&gt;. The second part is a deep dive into data warehousing. While it’s deep it’s still short. It’s a jumping off point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This post is part of that deep dive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Understanding ETL:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;ETL, or Extract, Transform, Load, is a process that enables businesses to gather data from different sources, convert it into a unified format, and load it into a centralized database for further modeling, analysis and reporting. You will also hear it referred to as ELT. The processes are very similar only signifying a change in the order of operations because the relative cost of storage has gone down significantly over time. ELT / ETL / EL-T it’s all about getting data into the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#x27;s break it down step by step:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extract&lt;/strong&gt;: The extraction phase involves pulling data from various channels such as Google Analytics, YouTube, social media platforms, paid traffic sources, eCommerce platforms, etc. Think of it as gathering puzzle pieces from different boxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transform&lt;/strong&gt;: Once the data is extracted, it needs to be transformed into a standardized format. This includes cleaning the data, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency. To learn more about the transformation step, check out this comprehensive guide to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://portable.io/learn/best-etl-tools&quot;&gt;best ETL tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Load&lt;/strong&gt;: After the data has been extracted and transformed, it is loaded into a central database or data warehouse where it can be accessed and analyzed. This step is crucial for creating a single source of truth for your data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In practice, these last two steps are flipped, leading to the acronym ELT. The terms are used interchangeably. With modern tools the extract and load activities have been replaced by automated data pipelines. These pipelines abstract the minutia of the process. So often engineers will refer to ELT anytime they are talking about data ingestion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Benefits of ETL tools for Business:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you buy a data warehouse you need to fill it. ETL tools help you do that. Good tools don’t cost, they pay. A good tool reduces the number of engineers you need to hire to manage your warehouse. Why bother? There are numerous benefits for businesses. Here are some key advantages:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holistic view of marketing data&lt;/strong&gt;: Consolidate data from various sources, giving you a comprehensive view of your marketing efforts. By bringing all the pieces of the puzzle together, you gain valuable insights for informed decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimization of marketing strategies&lt;/strong&gt;: With ETL, you can analyze and understand the impact of your marketing campaigns across different channels. This empowers you to optimize your strategies, allocate resources more effectively, and drive better results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Process automation&lt;/strong&gt;. A hidden benefit is automating manual tasks and processes, offering automation and increased efficiency. By centralizing data, syncing it to destinations that usually require manual intervention, and pushing it into downstream business processes, ETL pipelines provide value through process automation. Manual processes consume resources, while ETL pipelines automate the flow of information. This automation helps companies reduce operational costs, improve their bottom line, and establish a scalable foundation for innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Product development&lt;/strong&gt;. By leveraging existing data assets, ETL enables companies to create innovative offerings and generate new revenue streams. This approach applies to various industries, including e-commerce, finance, and healthcare, empowering businesses to provide value to customers and maintain a competitive edge. Product development is a crucial process that transforms raw data into valuable products. It integrates data from multiple sources and loads it into a target system, facilitating the quick development and release of new products, services, or features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a deep dive into ETL tools check out this comprehensive guide to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://portable.io/learn/best-etl-tools&quot;&gt;best ETL tools&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Addressing Concerns and Practical Tips for Data Governance:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing ETL may raise concerns about cost, complexity, and potential disruptions. However, with careful planning and execution, these concerns can be mitigated. Here are a few tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Start with a budget-friendly solution&lt;/strong&gt;: Many ETL tools offer flexible pricing options, allowing you to scale as your business grows.

Your business has amassed vast amounts of customer data over the years, ranging from purchase history and preferences to online interactions and feedback.The struggle is making sense of this scattered data, missed opportunities and a lack of strategic insights. At the speed of business, an effective data strategy is the key to unlocking your company&amp;#x27;s true potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you are pressed for time, you can download my &lt;a href=&quot;https://data-warehousing-for-dummies.assumewisely.com/&quot;&gt;data warehousing for dummies pdf&lt;/a&gt; to read later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Power of Data Warehousing: Illuminating the Path to Business Success&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data is the lifeblood of every successful enterprise. Businesses collect data from various sources: websites, social media, customer interactions, and sales transactions. Without the right tools and strategies to organize and utilize it, the data remains a jumble of numbers and words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data warehousing is the fundamental solution to the challenges of data management. At its core, data warehousing is the process of centralizing and structuring data from disparate sources into a single, unified repository. This consolidated data is then transformed into a format that is easily accessible, usable, and most importantly, actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actionable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Connection Between Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data warehousing and business intelligence (BI) go hand in hand, forming a powerful duo that drives strategic decision-making and provides a competitive edge in the market. By implementing a robust data warehousing system, businesses gain access to a comprehensive and reliable set of data, enabling them to derive valuable insights, patterns, and trends. This then serves as the foundation for successful Data Science and AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine a global e-commerce giant utilizing data warehousing to analyze customer behavior. They can identify purchasing patterns, popular products, and regional preferences, allowing them to tailor marketing campaigns, optimize supply chain operations, and improve overall customer satisfaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Real-World Success Stories: Data Warehousing in Action&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous successful companies have already harnessed the power of data warehousing to their advantage. For example, Netflix, the leading streaming service, uses data warehousing to track user interactions, content preferences, and viewing habits. This data-driven approach allows them to recommend personalized content to users, enhancing the overall user experience and keeping subscribers engaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another shining example is Amazon, the e-commerce behemoth. Their data warehousing practices enable them to optimize inventory management, predict demand, and provide timely product recommendations to customers, all contributing to increased sales and customer loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Overcoming Misconceptions: Addressing Concerns About Data Warehousing&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite its potential benefits, business owners and managers may have misconceptions or concerns about implementing data warehousing solutions. One common fear is that data warehousing is excessively complex and expensive, suitable only for large corporations with vast resources. However, with advancements in technology and the availability of cloud-based solutions, data warehousing has become more accessible and scalable, even for small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another concern revolves around the fear of data breaches and security vulnerabilities. While data security is of paramount importance, a well-designed data warehousing system can actually enhance data protection by centralizing data access and implementing robust encryption and access controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Key Steps in Setting up a Data Warehousing System&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To harness the true potential of data warehousing, businesses must follow a well-structured approach:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Data Quality and Data Governance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data quality is the foundation of effective data warehousing. Ensuring that data is accurate, consistent, and up-to-date is crucial for deriving reliable insights. Implementing strong data governance policies and procedures ensures that data is managed responsibly and ethically throughout its lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Scalability and Future-Proofing&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As businesses grow, their data needs will inevitably expand. A scalable data warehousing infrastructure anticipates this growth and allows seamless integration of new data sources without compromising performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Data Security and Compliance&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data security is a top priority in data warehousing. Complying with industry regulations and employing best practices for data protection instills confidence among customers and stakeholders, strengthening business relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Choosing the Right Data Warehousing Solution&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selecting the appropriate data warehousing solution can be overwhelming, considering the myriad of options available in the market. To make an informed decision, businesses should consider factors such as data volume, processing speed, scalability, integration capabilities, and cost-effectiveness. Cloud-based data warehousing solutions, like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, or Snowflake, offer the advantage of flexibility and cost savings, making them popular choices for many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Want to learn more?

Addressing these obstacles effectively is essential for maximizing the benefits of a data warehousing system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;1. Data Integration Complexities&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating data from various sources, each with its own format and structure, can be complex and time-consuming. Employing data integration tools and automation can streamline this process, reducing manual efforts and ensuring data accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;2. Performance Issues&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large datasets and complex queries can strain the performance of a data warehousing system. Proper data profiling, indexing, and performance tuning can optimize query execution times and enhance overall system performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;3. Handling Large Datasets&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As data volume increases, storage and processing requirements can become overwhelming. By leveraging cloud-based solutions, businesses can take advantage of virtually unlimited storage and computing resources, ensuring smooth operations even with massive datasets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data warehousing is a game-changer for businesses seeking to leverage their data assets for competitive advantage. By centralizing and organizing data, data warehousing unlocks valuable insights, drives data-driven decision-making, and empowers businesses to make informed choices that lead to success and growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through cloud-based solutions, automation, and data governance, businesses can overcome implementation challenges and embrace the full potential of data warehousing. In a world where data reigns supreme, data warehousing for dummies is a vital step toward a brighter, data-powered future for every business, big or small.

How do you value a master&amp;#x27;s degree... or any degree for that matter! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you you asking these same questions? If so, I believe my experience might be useful to you. I just earned my masters&amp;#x27;s at Western Governor&amp;#x27;s University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last several years I&amp;#x27;ve learned managers won&amp;#x27;t necessarily hire you because you have a master&amp;#x27;s degree, but they might skip you if you don&amp;#x27;t. It may not bear on the quality of your work, but it does seem to make getting work easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;My Decision to Go Back To School&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s after eleven on a Friday night. The food at Twin Donut  is cheap and greasy. We&amp;#x27;re waiting for our food because it&amp;#x27;s also the only place still open. Sitting at a table, I recount a scene from Good Will Hunting where Matt Damon, as Will, outwits and outsmarts an unoriginal snob in a bar closing with the classic flourish,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;You wasted $150,000 on an education you could have got for a buck fifty in late charges at the public library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pair of beautiful blue eyes across from me are unimpressed. All they see is a college dropout with no future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, I enroll for the following semester.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Four years later I graduate with a BS in Economics from Brigham Young University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;But Do I Need A Masters?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on in my career, I&amp;#x27;m having a frank talk with the director of my department. He thinks I don&amp;#x27;t need a master&amp;#x27;s degree: he doesn&amp;#x27;t have one. He believes in the value of learning, but the piece of paper doesn&amp;#x27;t matter. I believe him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over time I bring up this topic with several data scientists. I attend a confernece where it is addressed in a panel discussion. The general agreement is that you don&amp;#x27;t need a master&amp;#x27;s degree to be a data scientist. The strange thing? They all have master&amp;#x27;s degrees. Some of them - PhDs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time passes, my career goes nowhere. I&amp;#x27;m interviewing. I get in front of decision-makers but it seems there is always someone else with more experience they end up choosing. Everyone around me is promoted or hired into new positions. Over time I notice that this same director is fond of hiring  . . . master&amp;#x27;s degree holders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m fed up not seeing progress. I decided a master&amp;#x27;s degree might help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is A Master&amp;#x27;s Degree Worth?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high cost of tuition is often the first thing people think about when considering going back to school. It&amp;#x27;s no secret that the cost of higher education has been on the rise for years. According to The College Board, for the 2021-22 school year, private college tuition and fees averaged $38,070 while state residents attending public colleges paid an average of $10,740 per year. Out-of-state residents at public universities shelled out an average of $27,560 annually. Cost is the obvious challenge everyone likes to bring up. But focusing on cost alone is a mistake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I know many people with graduate degrees who work entry-level jobs. A graduate degree is no guarantee of a high-paying job. The value of a degree is not in the price tag. Price and value are  very different concepts. Price is what you pay, while value is the benefit you get. The value of a degree is in what it can do for you and - and - what you do with it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What A Master&amp;#x27;s Degree Will Do For You&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Graduate degrees typically act as a filter for hiring managers when they are trying to decide who to interview. HR managers are busy, with everyone in the program having been pre-screened, there&amp;#x27;s less of a chance the manager will waste time. The filtering aspect of graduate programs is very real, and difficult to overcome on your own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A degree can open doors not previously accessible. Once my resume displayed my newly minted  degree, I encountered less opposition throughout interviews. I started getting offers. It didn&amp;#x27;t seem to matter that it was post-dated to 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What a Master&amp;#x27;s Degree Will Not Do&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &amp;quot;The End of Business Schools? Less Success Than Meets the Eye,&amp;quot; a study published in &lt;em&gt;Academy of Management Learning and Education&lt;/em&gt; Jeffrey Pfeffer of Stanford University and Christina Fong of the University of Washington analyze forty years of data in an effort to find evidence that business schools make their graduates more successful. The result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business schools do  . . . almost nothing. Business schools are ineffective, as neither an MBA degree nor grades obtained in coursework correlate to professional success. Getting an MBA has zero correlation with long-term career success. None.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By now I start to see a master&amp;#x27;s degree will get me to the interview. And help me look less risky as a new hire. After that it is all on me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Value A Degree&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;My student debt is shown as a liability on my financial statements. That doesn&amp;#x27;t give the whole story. It simply shows how I paid for school. On the other side of my financial statement, I have an asset called human capital. Now, what is the value of my human capital asset?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On my financials, I record the value as what I paid. This offsets my loan so it&amp;#x27;s a wash and keeps things simple. It really doesn&amp;#x27;t matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does matter? The proportion of my student loan payment to the increase in earnings. According to a Payscale study, the typical wage for someone with a bachelor&amp;#x27;s degree is $60,000 per year. However, the average income for individuals without a bachelor&amp;#x27;s degree is only $47,000. Is it worth going back for a batchelor&amp;#x27;s?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The batchelor&amp;#x27;s degree holder makes around $1,000 extra each month. With a student loan payment of about $300, that leaves $700 more to spend every month. That investment makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can expect to make over $100,000 as a data scientist. Perhaps not right away, but certainly over time. That is twice as much as the original non-degree employee. Even if your student loan payment is double - triple - that investment makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brush Your Teeth&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;How to make sense of it all? There is evidence that an MBA has no real influence. Many people in the business agree. In fact, before I finished my degree, I started a new job - twice. So... Do you truly need one?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The filtering aspect of graduate programs is very real, and difficult to overcome on your own. Look at a degree as a hygiene factor like brushing your teeth. Good hygiene doesn&amp;#x27;t win you a date, but bad hygiene will loose you a date. Similarly, managers won&amp;#x27;t necessarily hire you because you have a master&amp;#x27;s degree, but they might skip you if you don&amp;#x27;t. It may not bear on the quality of your work, but it does seem to make getting work easier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a mistake to believe a degree will do all the heavy lifting. My career growth (ahem, income) is largely due to the field I pursued, business intelligence reporting as a BI developer. My earnings return is largely influenced by my line of work. It&amp;#x27;s crucial to consider the area in which you want to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The degree checks a box and clears the way for you to advance. I just needed a little leverage to get in a specific door, I believe my degree helped me do that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why WGU&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#x27;re having trouble finding employment or advancing in your career, a graduate degree may give you an edge in your career journey. You don&amp;#x27;t need to overspend. A degree is a degree. You need it, doesn&amp;#x27;t matter from where. The less you spend, the better your ROI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WGU was a great fit for me. I am a non-traditional student. I grew up in a culture that did not value education. I&amp;#x27;m a parent. I work full time. I cannot quit either of those responsibilities. I needed to squeeze graduate school around those responsibilities. Working at my own pace allowed me to better manage everything else going on in my life. WGU not only understood my needs, they met them - and the price was very reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Are you walking?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I graduated from Brigham Young, I skipped the graduation ceremony. I didn&amp;#x27;t &amp;quot;walk&amp;quot;. I just wanted that piece of paper. That didn&amp;#x27;t change when enrolling at WGU - I just wanted that piece of paper to list on my resume. Along the way that changed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, I walked for two reasons: so both of them could see their dad earn a master&amp;#x27;s degree. My first experience at a graduate degree ceremony was my own.  I wanted their experience to be different. Growing up, I didn&amp;#x27;t see many people who look like me earning degrees. I want their experience to be different. I grew up in a culture that did not value education. I want their experience to be different.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Values Based Leadership for the Modern Age]]></title><description><![CDATA[

In order to navigate through the constant uncertainty and chaos, organizations need leaders who can make decisions based on enduring values, not short-term pivots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does it mean to be a values-based leader in the modern age? What do values do for an organization? And how you can use them to navigate the challenges of modern business? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/where_have_all_the_good_men_gone.png&quot; alt=&quot;Where Have All the Good Men Gone&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leaders provide stability in an unstable environment, inspire teams to achieve great things. Embrace values-based leadership to create a culture of trust in your organization, your tribe, from employees to shareholders, better decision-making,greater creativity and innovation. Looking for ways to become a more effective leader? Read on – you may find just what you need!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why Values Matter&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago was an awful time in my life. Saturday afternoon, I’m unloading groceries. I don&amp;#x27;t remember what set me off, I just remember chucking the giant Costco package of toilet paper across my lawn in the general direction of my front door. I&amp;#x27;d had it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was tired. Tired of being broke. Tired of all the crap in my life. Too much nagging. Not enough sex. Too much weight. Not enough exercise. Too much work. Not enough results. Too much month at the end of the money. And my kids...my only reason to endure, were killing me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I dreaded the weekend. Another reminder of how much my life sucked. At least when I went to work, I could focus on work and take my mind off things. Monday mornings were the worst: the inevitable question, what did I do over the weekend? The truth is, I spent my weekends simmering, waiting for Monday because we were broke. I couldn&amp;#x27;t afford to do anything.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My wife&amp;#x27;s had it too. &amp;quot;It&amp;#x27;s never enough,&amp;quot; she says, &amp;quot;You&amp;#x27;re never happy.&amp;quot; My wife is tired. Tired of seeing me like this. She is right of course. I keep repeating the same line: the idea that when I graduate college, get my first job, get a new job, make a certain amount of money . . . then I&amp;#x27;ll be happy. But that isn&amp;#x27;t true at all! I keep moving the goal posts because each step doesn&amp;#x27;t make me happier, it just frustrates me more that I am not where I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are some benefits of having strong company values in place?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you come across a community that can clearly identify its values,  it has an attractive force. Values are inherently fuzzy. We&amp;#x27;re all seeking them in some form. When a community finds them it&amp;#x27;s natural want to participate in something that is larger than yourself. It pulls you in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I wasn&amp;#x27;t simmering on the weekends, I worked at Entrata. Entrata is exceptional in living it’s values. Entrata is a fun place to work, it’s a value: business in the front, party in the back. We worked hard, we played hard.  It was easy to adopt Entrata’s values as my own. It was easy to resonate with them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When values are clear it creates trust. It creates a common ground you can build on. It builds the foundation of a relationship. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also modeled for me how to live intentionally and not by default. I needed to see that. It gave me permission to do likewise. It prodded me to look at my own values. To turn the default setting off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are some common pitfalls to avoid when developing company values?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That default setting is what I call shouldy values: focusing on what should be, what I should have had by now. At the time I suffered from shouldy values. One in particular: Big house. Nice car. I didn&amp;#x27;t even want that big a house, just bigger. I didn&amp;#x27;t even want that nice a car, just nicer. In the absence of actual values those shouldy values end up as a fairly common default:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? Tour bus, studio, and the fans, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? To feed my family and my friends,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? To change your world the best I can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEk_XPY1sSg&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s It All For&lt;/a&gt;, Bazaar Royal&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acknowleging these default shouldy values is an important first step. Acknowledging the bad values isn&amp;#x27;t the same as discovering the valuable ones. Now, how is discovery achieved? I can only speak to my own journey. It was &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/values-2015&quot;&gt;a long process&lt;/a&gt; of figuring things out as I went along. It&amp;#x27;s not learning something new; It&amp;#x27;s simply remembering what you already know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discovering values is an art. It&amp;#x27;s creative expression. It isn&amp;#x27;t additive, like molding clay. It&amp;#x27;s subtractive, like carving into stone. You&amp;#x27;re looking to unearth something under the surface. It&amp;#x27;s always been there. Don&amp;#x27;t try to create new values; all you can truely do is expose the real ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Mistake That Is Costing You&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a look at what you wrote in your last performance evaluation. Do you concentrate on your actions? Take a look at your resume. Where is the emphasis? Is it on your accomplishments? Consider the last excellent movie you saw or book you read. What can you tell me about it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#x27;t give away the plot! Focusing on the &amp;#x27;what&amp;#x27; is a temptation everyone falls prey to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with &amp;quot;Why.&amp;quot; Simon Sinek wrote a book on it, but you can get away with just watching his TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/start_with_why_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;Start With Why&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone (and everyone) can tell you what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some can talk about how. This is 90% of what marketers will focus on: differentiating value proposition, proprietary process, secret sauce, or USP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few discuss the importance of Why, Purpose, Cause, Belief. However, these are crucial to consider. Why do you wake up every day? More importantly, why should anyone care? People don&amp;#x27;t buy what you do--they buy why you do it. Your product simply serves as proof of what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. It is not making money; that is a result. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start with Why, then follow it up with How and What.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How can you go about developing your own company values?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entrata continuously invests in its values, it&amp;#x27;s not a one-time thing. It starts with interviews--my friend preped me that they would ask about the company&amp;#x27;s values. They did. Every week, we encouraged each other to live up to these values. &amp;quot;Talk to me Goose&amp;quot;, TTMG, was common shorthand for communication as was &amp;quot;Be Excellent&amp;quot; to .... our customers ... each other, etc. Values were on display at Values week as well as other company events. Each year during our annual review, we addressed how well we lived up to the Entrata values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I said before Entrata is a fun place to work: business in the front, party in the back. The symbol of that particular value is the mullet.  At Entrata the conference rooms are named after famous mullets: there is Aggassi, Norris, Bolton, and Cyrus just to name a few. Walk into Norris and the large display monitor has a screensaver featuring . . . Chuck Norris. That&amp;#x27;s cool. That&amp;#x27;s fun. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming to Purple Innovation I see a similar theme to our conference rooms. Instead of famous mullets, Purple&amp;#x27;s conference rooms are named after scientists: Da Vinci, Tesla, Edison. It&amp;#x27;s not listed as one of our values, but &amp;quot;Thanks Science!&amp;quot; is a popular phrase Purple uses for swag and social media. Science isn&amp;#x27;t expressly stated in our current values; it underlies several of them. As a data analyst, that is attractive. I believe in science, I invest in knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Start with Why&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I bought &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3Tmc3HF&quot;&gt;Start With Why&lt;/a&gt; hoping to learn how. The book comes up short on teaching how. The book focuses on why it matters and at the end Simon upsells his $100 course to help you find your why. I opted to figure it out on my own-- read still broke. It took a little over a year to nail down a repeatable process. But it was free! If you are interested in learning how I did it, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It can be tough to figure out your Why. It&amp;#x27;s innately fuzzy and &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/values-2015&quot;&gt;hard to pin down&lt;/a&gt;. Your goal is to bring it into sharp focus. That might take some time. Keep revisiting the idea, and you&amp;#x27;ll get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My initial efforts were strongly influenced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3KqROVx&quot;&gt;Strengths Finder 2.0 Assessment&lt;/a&gt;. I strongly recommend this assessment; it&amp;#x27;s free when you buy &lt;a href=&quot;https://amzn.to/3KqROVx&quot;&gt;Strengths Finder 2.0&lt;/a&gt;. This is a fantastic tool for determining your natural talents to set you apart from the crowd. Strenghts are your USP, your secret sauce. This task is well worth your time. Even as I studied my talents I was keenly aware that I was missing the mark. Strengths speak to your How not your Why. Strengths aren&amp;#x27;t the same as purpose. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s ironic that the question Simon Sinek leaves unanswered in his TED talk is answered by another TED talk: How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes by Adam Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/life_purpose_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The term &amp;quot;elevator pitch&amp;quot; is something you&amp;#x27;re undoubtedly familiar with. Adam goes through a series of questions to help you articulate yours in under five minutes: your own elevator pitch that starts with why. You can check out mine on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/rholall/&quot;&gt;LinkedIn Profile&lt;/a&gt;. Or my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.instagram.com/rho_lall/&quot;&gt;Instagram Bio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is starting with Why. This is real progress. This is material acomplishment. This is . . . not enough. This is not going to weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storm comes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Cure For Shouldy Values&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are going to fill out &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a bracket for your values&lt;/a&gt;. Think March Madness, but with values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is most easily done using Post-It notes. I&amp;#x27;ve started you off with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a pretty good list of values&lt;/a&gt;. Look for ideas in this list, or simply google &amp;quot;list of values.&amp;quot; On a post-it notes, write down the values that appeal to you. One value per Post-It. If a term attracts your attention, note it down on a post-it. Don&amp;#x27;t edit yourself at this step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create categories such as relationships, things, talents, traits, and skills. You should already have a stack of post-it notes on hand. Sort your notes into these categories. Overlook this step and you may have to start over because you prioritize certain categories above others. In the last stage, it will become obvious why this is significant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, fill out your bracket. Hold a tournament for each category (think March Madness). Each value will compete against another. Consider a pair of values. If you have to pick one, which do you keep? The winner advances. Repeat until there is a clear winner for each category. You can repeat the process to determine second place and so on until your values are ranked for each category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The categories are crucial because you might prioritize one category over another. This was my experience: even though I highly value knowledge, values in other categories killed it off simply because knowledge is a thing. I value things least. I realized the need for categories when I saw knowledge dropping deep down in the ranking. Play with it, flex the bracket to meet your needs. The bracket is designed to spark your own intuition. It&amp;#x27;s not intended as an objective measure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Knowing your company&amp;#x27;s values can help you with tough decisions&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Values are a tool of effective leadership. Values afford leaders the leverage they need so they don&amp;#x27;t have to be present in every meeting. Values create leverage for thinking and decision making. What do I mean? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I have a disagreement with my wife, we have a few  options:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Concede. That&amp;#x27;s my go-to. For most things it just doesn&amp;#x27;t matter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Persist. Endure.  Bully. Until the other person concedes. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Compromise. No one gets what they want.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Leverage our common values.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take a step back. Remeber who we are and what we value. Elevate the discussion to a higher plane. Base our discussion from a position of common ground. Leverage our values to make the decision. Ask, &amp;quot;What do people like us who hold these values do in this situation?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now your values become a tool. Your values are the foundational data your tribe has available to make informed decisions. They are the fundamental building block that drives everything else in the org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tell Me Your Story.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We all forget. We all need to be reminded of our purpose. Jamie Dimon once said, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Leadership is relentless storytelling.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Tell me your story. Do the work, what story is yours to tell? It&amp;#x27;s a story about you, your tribe, and what you do for them. It starts with what you believe, what you value. But it can&amp;#x27;t just be about you. Your story is about what you do to help your tribe to reach their ideal, achieve thier goals, overcome thier trials. You need to be really clear about who you are, what you believe, and how you stand out. You need to be clear so you can clearly communicate to your tribe. How else will they know? When you share your values it will resonate with them. They will be better for it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is your contribution, what you do to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Business Intelligence Reporting Drives Data-Driven Decision Making]]></title><description><![CDATA[

It helps business leaders make data-driven decisions, which in turn leads to better customer experiences, optimized churn rates, and accelerated growth. There are two distinct services involved in business intelligence reporting: curated content and self-service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Advantages of BI Reporting&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making business decisions based on data rather than intuition or guesswork can lead to a better outcome for your business. Data-driven decision-making allows you to use actual information rather than a hunch or best guess to make choices about how to move your business forward. This can be especially helpful when it comes to areas like marketing, where making the wrong choice can mean losing customers and revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data-driven decision-making is also important when it comes to reducing churn. If you can identify which customers are most likely to leave, you can take steps to prevent them from doing so. Additionally, using data to make decisions about product development can help you create products that are more in line with what your customers want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, using data rather than intuition or guesswork to make business decisions can lead to better outcomes for your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How BI Reporting Drives Data-Driven Decision Making&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most business leaders are faced with the challenge of dealing with too much data. Data is more and more ubiquitous, it&amp;#x27;s too much to sift through when making important decisions. Leaders do not have the time to sort through all of the data themselves in order to find the insights they need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business intelligence reporting is the process of transforming data into insights that add value to the business. It helps business leaders make data-driven decisions, which in turn leads to better customer experiences, optimized churn rates, and accelerated growth. BI reporting encompasses two distinct services: curated content and self-service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first service is a curated collection of assets such as data composition requests (csv data dumps), reports, and dashboards. Most decision-makers want to consume curated content. They don&amp;#x27;t want to build it themselves. The second service is providing an experience where business leaders can self-serve and dive into the data to answer questions at the speed of business. These two needs are at odds. There is data that needs to be right. There is data that needs to be right . . . now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to do this, business intelligence reporting requires governance and processes to ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and scalable. This means ensuring a single source of truth that is consistent across different departments and platforms. This can be important when you are expanding your business and need to make sure that all of your data is aligned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business intelligence reporting helps business leaders focus on the business rather than on data management. By providing business leaders with curated content and self-service experiences, business intelligence reporting allows them to make data-driven decisions quickly and efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Trend Reports&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business intelligence reporting can help business leaders identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent when looking at raw data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A trend report is a type of business intelligence report that helps business leaders identify trends and patterns that may not be immediately apparent when looking at raw data. Trend reports can help business leaders make decisions about where to allocate resources in order to capitalize on current trends and avoid potential pitfalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating a trend report, it is important to consider the time frame that the report covers. Is the trend increasing or decreasing? What is the direction of the trend? Is it linear or exponential? What is the cause and effect relationship between different factors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also important to use graphs and visuals to help business leaders understand the data. Trends are often difficult to spot when looking at raw data, but can be easily identified when presented in a graphical format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trend reports can be helpful for business leaders in all industries, but they are especially useful for businesses in fast-paced industries like technology and retail. By staying ahead of the curve, business leaders in these industries can ensure that they are not left behind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Comparative Analysis (Comps)&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparative analysis reports are business intelligence reports that compare two or more data sets. They can be used to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several different types of comparative analysis reports. The most common type is a side-by-side comparison report. This report compares two sets of data head-to-head. It can be used to identify which data set is larger, which data set is more recent, or which data set is more accurate. A common comparison is to compare a previous period in time, last year, last quarter, or last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A waterfall report is another type of comparative analysis report. This report compares multiple data sets and identifies how each data set relates to the others. It can be used to track changes in data over time or to identify relationships between different factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Comparative analysis reports can be helpful for business leaders in all industries, but they are especially useful for businesses that operate in multiple geographies. By comparing data from different markets, businesses can identify trends and patterns that may not be apparent when looking at data from a single market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;##How to Create a BI Report
When it comes to business intelligence reporting, one of the most important aspects is the quality of the data. In order to ensure that data is accurate and relevant, business intelligence reporting requires a certain level of governance and processes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When it comes to business intelligence reporting, one of the most important aspects is the quality of the data. In order to ensure that data is accurate and relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way to achieve this is by using a layered approach to development. This approach divides  data processing into multiple layers, each of which is responsible for a different aspect of the development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In software development, the data layer is responsible for developing and managing the data that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes collecting data from various sources, cleansing and transforming the data, and loading the data into a database.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The business layer is responsible for developing the logic that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes developing algorithms and formulas, creating queries, and building reports and dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The presentation layer is responsible for developing the user interface that will be used in business intelligence reports. This includes designing screens, setting up navigation, and creating buttons and controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By using a layered approach, business intelligence reporting can be effectively managed and maintained. The layers work together to ensure that data is accurate and relevant, and that business leaders have the information they need to make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tips for Using BI Reporting Effectively&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business intelligence reporting can be a powerful tool for business leaders, but it is not effective unless it is used correctly. Here are a few tips for using business intelligence reporting effectively:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Make sure the data is accurate and relevant.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use a layered approach to development.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Follow best practices for data governance.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Use business intelligence reports to make informed decisions.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With business intelligence reporting in place, companies can trust the data they are working with to make informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Finding My Voice]]></title><description><![CDATA[In my early 20's my first blog failed before it ever started.]]></description><link>https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/ai-strategy/voice</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/ai-strategy/voice</guid><pubDate>Sun, 19 Sep 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In my early 20&amp;#x27;s my first blog failed before it ever started. I struggled with finding my voice. To be candid, I had a voice, just not one I could publish. I feared my voice would betray me as youthful, inexperienced, and stupid,
because I was all these things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My struggle came to a head when I read Stephen Covey&amp;#x27;s 8th Habit (of Successful People). According to Covey, expressing your voice is a key to lifelong holistic success. I took that to heart but fundamentally found the book frustrating because I didn&amp;#x27;t see myself as able to offer anything of value.  At the time I thought, maybe when I&amp;#x27;m 40, I&amp;#x27;ll have something useful to share. Well, now I do. And while I still fear that I might reveal my inexperience and stupidity, my years of experience betray me. It&amp;#x27;s about time I stopped using these excuses.
What can I say today that could help my 20-year-old self?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be a little bitch. Man up. Grow a pair. Drop your sack. Do man-shit. Stop caring about what other people think of you. Start caring about what you think of you.
While that remains true to who I am and has supported me, it isn’t true for who I was. I’m sure that little bitch had something useful to share. What more could I say to help him out?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pay attention to the chapter endings. As you live your life, chapters develop. Chapters will begin and chapters will end. Be mindful of when the chapters end. Take a beat. Summarize the lessons learned. Write it down. This is not the same as journaling which is capturing the experiences of the day. Journaling has its value: by all means, journal. But know that the real value is in the stories that leave an impression on your soul. What memories form the cornerstone of your character. What is remarkable? What should be remembered? What is useful? What do you want to pass on? To answer these kinds of questions a little distance is helpful. Give yourself some space to tell the whole story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overcoming cringe-worthy writing. When I read what I have written in the past, I cringe. That has held me back. It’s kept me from publishing. It&amp;#x27;s only natural to feel concerned. It&amp;#x27;s reasonable to expect judgment on my thoughts and how well I express them. My writing is a reflection of me.  I’ve found that when I cringe, it&amp;#x27;s actually evidence I’ve progressed as a writer. There is a delta between where I was as a writer and where I am today. I remind myself, I can always re-write. There is no such thing as great writing, only great rewriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write. Have the discipline to write every day. Just writing will not make you a better writer but not writing is detrimental. Take it seriously. Take a writing class. Take more than one. Recognize that there are professional writers who have spent years honing the craft.  Respect writing as the skill that it is. Work at it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inexperience is a liability. I can’t sugarcoat that. It is. Business moves fast. Some degree of on-the-job training is expected but hiring managers have problems that they are hiring to solve. If you don’t have solutions...it’s going to be a tough sell. Don&amp;#x27;t wear inexperience on your sleeve, but don’t think you need to experience everything yourself. We do learn best from our own experience but we can leverage the experiences of others. A great place to start is Covey&amp;#x27;s two books on habits and of course subscribe to my blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Default to action. There&amp;#x27;s no time like the present. You&amp;#x27;re not promised tomorrow. None of us are. Today is all you have. Tomorrow doesn&amp;#x27;t exist. Each day you awake, it&amp;#x27;s today. Tomorrow never comes. The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago. The next best time is today. The same idea applies here.
Default to action. Fail splendidly. Learn. Do it again. It is easier to iterate and improve than to &amp;quot;get it right&amp;quot; the first time. Perfection is an illusion. Just get it done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your stories and experience have value. In this post I’ve shared some ideas on how to unlock those stories:
Default to action
Pay attention to the chapter endings
Overcome cringy-ness
Write
Unlocking the stories is only part of the solution. Unlocking value is another part. In my next blog, I&amp;#x27;ll get into overcoming barriers to unlock and realize value.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The First 20 Hours]]></title><description><![CDATA[I built this first 20 hours time tracker to implement Josh Kaufman's principles.

Affluence—not willpower—seems to be what’s behind some kids&amp;#x27; capacity to delay gratification. Here are some take aways i clipped from social media posts:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The “marshmallow test” is really an “affluence/privilege test.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Poorer kids would be less motivated to wait...b/c life holds fewer guarantees:  a second marshmallow seems irrelevant when a child has reason to believe that the first one might vanish.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Turns out children&amp;#x27;s family economic security--not their individual grit--is a reliable predictor of their long-term success.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My friends, you hit a nerve. My frayed, exposed nerve. You might call this a rant. This gets in the face of the American fable: work hard, persevere, succeed. At first it was hard to swallow because I believe the fable. But now I’ve taken time to ponder. From discomfort my feelings have transformed. Now I’m pissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separate the research from the politics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research suggests that grit is not a cause but rather a correlated outcome. One’s background, not the ability to delay gratification (grit), drives long-term success. Circumstances matter. Among kids whose mothers had a college degree, those who waited for a second marshmallow did no better in the long run than those who dug right in.
Among kids whose mothers did not have college degrees, those who waited did no better than those who gave in to temptation. For those kids, self-control alone couldn’t overcome economic and social disadvantages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That can all be true. Let’s go one further, it’s true. A given fact, rich kids have more advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What now?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you tell that poor kid with the teenage mom and no dad?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic has a message for that kid. Read the last sentence of the article: for poor children, indulging in a small bit of joy today can make life feel more bearable, especially when there’s no guarantee of more joy tomorrow. It isn’t intentional. Admittedly, I’ve  taken the sentence out of context. Doesn’t matter. The subtext is there. The message is poor children are poor thru no fault of their own (true) and they are powerless to do anything about it (um . . . not true).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I can’t support that. The american fable is replete with examples of people who have pulled themselves up by their bootstraps. So what do you say to that poor kid with the teenage mom whose dad isn’t in his life? Give up, there is nothing you can do. Really? Do you believe that? Here is an odd thought. Instead of coming up with an answer maybe listen to what he has to say. Specifically what one such kid has to say to his own son.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Greatness Is Upon You&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of my favorite people on the planet, Eric Thomas. When I’m down he is my best kept secret. I’ve watched this video countless times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/Oy0Lj7RkjkU&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/greatness_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;Greatness is Upon You&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;sn’t Eric talking about the exact same thing as the study? He is. It was easy for Eric to drop out of school because his dad dropped out. As did his grandfather. He hates school but, he is getting his PhD. Why? Because he understands that his son’s success is tied to his own success. &lt;strong&gt;Greatness is here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;I Didn’t Get Here By Making Excuses.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic is on some bullsh*t because the only thing you can control in this life is yourself. They are effectively taking that away. They want to feed you excuses. Will you take the bait? You will if you don’t know &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/inspire-action&quot;&gt;what you want&lt;/a&gt;. You owe it to yourself to know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/7Oxz060iedY&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/you_owe_you_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;You Owe You&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/inspire-action&quot;&gt;Find out what you want&lt;/a&gt; and then spend the rest of your natural life waking up and going after it. But you don’t want to hear that, do you? You don’t want to hear about the guy who wakes up at 2:30 in the morning to grind for the same opportunities you were given. You want to hear about 5 tips and tricks to make life easier. You want the life-hacks, not &lt;a href=&quot;/thoughts/inspire-action&quot;&gt;the life-hammer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I was that kid. I decided I wasn’t going to be disadvantaged as a statistic but rather I was going to take the advantage with statistics. I accepted the grind, the fight, the work, to do everything in my power to press forward every single day and learn what I’m missing along the way. Because winners win. And losers lose. I didn’t get here making excuses. I wake up and I grind. No alarm clock required: my passion wakes me up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I decided I wasn’t going to be disadvantaged as a statistic but rather I was going to take the advantage with statistics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I live in America. I am a hispanic male. They don’t treat us the same, something called racism. I’m not crying about it. There will be racism until the day I die. I am not going to cry about it; I’m still going to be a millionaire. I’m still going to be one of the top data professionals in the world. No I didn’t grow up on that side of the town. My mom doesn’t have a network. I don’t “know people.” I’m not at a country club. I don’t play golf. I’m still going to be successful. I’m still going to get to where they are because I owe it to myself. Nobody can stop me but me.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take Your Shot&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;To succeed you only have to hit life hard one good time in the mouth. But you need to hang in there until you get your shot. When your shot comes around, take it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/G_CDIQuM_vQ&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/take_the_shot_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;Take Your Shot&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week I heard the story for the first time. The time Eric Thomas learned greatness was upon him. This is his origin story. Pastor Willis takes this homeless 17 year old high school dropout and with love tells him to get his GED and go to college. He says, “because greatness is upon you.” 17 years old. Living in an abandoned building. Smelly, because he doesn’t shower. Bad breath from eating garbage and not brushing after. Pastor Willis says, “Greatness is Upon You.” And now he who was admonished uses his gift to admonish us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So what do you say to the kid whose mother doesn&amp;#x27;t have a college degree? Those who wait for the marshmallow will fare no better than those who give in. Self-control alone will not overcome economic and social disadvantage. What do you say? What do you say to yourself? That kid inside you? What. do. you. say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greatness. Is. Upon. You.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic makes a classic error. Winners focus on winning. Losers focus on winners.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Make Everyone Data Savvy, Forget Data Science.]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Mckinsey predicts a shortfall in meeting the demand for 1.5 million data savvy managers. According to the American Management Association 75% of companies report they are ill-equipped to meet current analytics needs. Here are six skills tech startups are looking for in a data savvy manager: listen, ask great questions, understand data science, evaluate alternatives, acknowledge and mitigate bias,  and catalyze change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major hurdle to iterate and improve strategic data driven decision making is people. Data analytics is pretty straight forward; i.e. math is just that, math. It&amp;#x27;s people (humans) that can be challenging. Which means people (could that be you?) are the solution. Data science relies heavily on statistical computing. Scripts and math. Algorithms. If (1) you start with good data and (2) you have a competent data scientist conduct and interpret the analysis, you still need (3) to put those results into context; make something happen. Someone has to do! Teams (doers) need to execute on insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The good news is that you don’t have to know how to code or do advanced maths to become data-savvy. In fact, you don’t have to be particularly tech savvy at all. What you do have to do is adopt a data-friendly mindset. Whether you are looking to lead the way as a data-savvy employee, or lead the charge for culture change as a manager or C-level executive, here are some suggestions for encouraging everyone in your organization to become data savvy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Six skills tech startups are looking for in data savvy managers&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Listen.&lt;/strong&gt; Understand the problems your team, senior, &amp;amp; mid-level managers are facing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask great questions.&lt;/strong&gt; Focus on how to ask the right questions rather than the method of arriving at the answers. Frame the problem into a set of questions that, if answered, direct action. Understand (&amp;amp; communicate) that decisions must be made once these questions are answered. Help other managers to do the same. A data-savvy manager structures a strategic problem and facilitates discussion to reach an actionable resolution or decision. Strategic questions and sub-questions will drive the analytic process and must always be clearly tied back to the business need and desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understand data science.&lt;/strong&gt; Some basic understanding of what data is and how it is collected is all that is needed to start to see the bigger picture.  If you can store it, you can analyse it; so what data do you already store in your job? What could you learn from it?Take a survey level course on data science. LinkedIn Learning offers a course that you can get through in an afternoon. When you understand the process you can ask actionable questions that lend themselves to be answered with a data model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the planning phase, data-savvy managers must consider how to strategically advance the data decision process. By understanding the data platform and clear objectives for the data needs, the manager will be able to communicate effectively with the scientists or engineers and drive the needed data collection, modeling and analysis, based on the desired outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having an understanding of the platform and the vision of what can be achieved, a data-savvy manager can identify opportunities to continue building out the desired analytical platform and the resources to further develop their data decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acknowledge and mitigate bias.&lt;/strong&gt; Team members have (and use) inherent bias. Teams that manage group-think will naturally make better evaluations. Recognize and mitigate the inherent biases team members have. Involve the project team early in workshops for critical thinking and creative problem solving. Have them offer insights into biases and identify required resources upfront. Involving the whole team allows discussion to focus around the strategic problem and ultimately get its buy in on the plan moving forward. Early buy-in is important for establishing accountability and responsibility throughout the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catalyze change.&lt;/strong&gt; Communicate and empower decisions throughout the organization. The most common problem is the role the organizational culture plays in utilizing analytics. Senior managers, mid-level managers and technical personnel all share responsibility for developing a culture to implement these decisions quickly. Employees, whether technically skilled or not, should recognize that data has the potential to impact every aspect of the business. Champion this message throughout the organization and begin shifting the organizational culture to one that is data decision-oriented. Achieving early small wins can lead to big victories toward ultimately changing the organizational culture through the demonstration of value created for the firm and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data Savvy Managers Drive Processes&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These six skills are crucial to developing processes.  If you&amp;#x27;re in finance, you need analytics for risk; supply chain, then you need optimization; for marketing, customer segmentation. You can see the demand and the need. While each vertical has it&amp;#x27;s own nuance, each process has these four components in common:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;generate meaningful questions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;pose those questions effectively&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;build understanding around data driven decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a culture that can implement those decisions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in a variety of roles are starting to understand the value of being data-savvy. Data is already becoming ubiquitous in business as well as in daily life. It used to be that the IT department could be contained to its own office or floor, but today, it’s becoming harder and harder to segregate the realm of data from any other aspect of business. That means that data — and the application and analysis of said data — is going to become more and more important in every department, from sales to HR and from R&amp;amp;D to marketing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Predictive analytics: Using past and current data to answer questions about the future&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scorecarding: Tracking business metrics against strategic and operational outcomes for better decision making&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Dashboards: Real-time presentations and aggregations of relevant data&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Social analytics: Metrics from social media and networks&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Content analytics: Assessment of available content and how it is used&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Web analytics: Tracking traffic and key words used to find particular sites&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Different kinds of data and analyses can be used to influence behavior, improve organizational policies and practices, or make better decisions. Processes within a business are generally places where you generate a lot of data and can manage data more efficiently. These can be great places to get staff on board with a new data-centric culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;There is no such thing as &amp;quot;perfect data&amp;quot;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data newbies need to be taught and reminded that there are always anomalies in data sets, and that data needs to go through quality control and be cleaned before it is useful. Building these concepts and processes in from the start will eliminate big headaches later. Just accepting this fact will reduce headaches. Before you can analyse data it needs to be cleaned, (wrangled or munged). Data wrangling is 80% of the work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A data savvy manager doesn&amp;#x27;t have to code or be a math expert&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data scientists are “deep analytical talent”: people with solid backgrounds in applied math, economics, or life science. They are skeptical, communicative, curious, and creative. They know more statistics than engineers and more engineering than statisticians. Data savvy professionals, on the other hand, have these qualities but not the same level of technical training. They can think of problems as data-driven or analytical. They know how to think about data, how to ask the right questions and challenge the answers they receive. In short, data science requires rare (specialist) qualities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;an ability to take unstructured data and find order, meaning, and value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deep analytical talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Savvy doesn&amp;#x27;t. a data-savvy manager incorporate all of the information into the decision-making process. Whether it is information marketing will use for customer segmentation, or research and development for knowledge discovery, there must be an avenue for the information to be incorporated into the decision making process. A data-savvy manager must structure the process with the end in mind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data savvy doesn&amp;#x27;t require you to code or be a math expert, check out my learner&amp;#x27;s guide to becoming a data savvy manager. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Networking Overrated?]]></title><description><![CDATA[

That person with the perfect elevator pitch. That person who knows how to work a room. That person who keeps winning friends and influencing people. That that person who never eats alone. That person who&amp;#x27;s the quintessential networker. Don&amp;#x27;t you just hate them? Maybe not outright, but did you know networking skills have more to do with career progression than any other skill? Eighty percent of job openings are never publicly advertised: so maybe you just hate that somehow networking and making connections is SO easy to them and every time you try it feels sleazy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you feel networking is sleazy, slimy, and scammy? You are not alone. One study showed that thinking about networking subconsciously invoked a preoccupation with hygiene and grooming. Translation: networking makes us feel dirty. It’s easier to be disgusted by networking than to learn how to do it right — a classic pre-emptive defense mechanism. Unfortunately, the dismissive pleasure is short-lived. While you cry scam other people are getting ahead — ethically and rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tricky part is keeping in touch with your network of colleagues and clients in a genuine way, so you don’t come off as self-serving. How do you maintain your connections over the long haul so that you can call when you need help (e.g., a job reference or a professional favor)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keep reading, in the next six minutes you will find out what the experts have said than can make you a better networker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Difference Between Important &amp;amp; Urgent&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you cry with those that mourn you get the benefit of hindsight. Let their hindsight be your foresight. Read these examples to see if there isn’t a reflection of yourself in between the lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;”I regret not taking advantage of the multiple networking events that occur due to the type of business my company is in. I could have made a ton of networking contacts that could have facilitated career advancement.” - Sean&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“After ~11 years, I find myself in role largely dictated by the first position I took out of college…. I’ve looked into other positions but found a reverse grass-is-greener problem — everything else seems boring or unimportant. My skills outside of my career are varied and vibrant, always expanding, but something about the daily grind has ground me down.” - Jeff&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish that 4 years ago when I realized I wanted to make a career change and go into psychology, I hadn’t been deterred by the application process. I could be partially through my graduate degree by now, rather than trying to figure out how I’m going to change careers, get married, and start a family. I balked because I didn’t know who to get recommendations from.” - Erin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Taking two full years to realize that being a “self-starter” wasn’t just a trait you were born with – it’s something that’s cultivated, aggressively…I took the “appropriate” career path, but sat back waiting for a job to come to me.” - Nita&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish I would have started networking and talking to people earlier. I had always assumed that accomplishments were only worth it if you did it completely alone, but every successful person around me has a large network of people that has helped them to get there. I don’t have to do everything myself; there’s no shame in getting other people to help, especially at the stuff I’m not good at.” - Andrea&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I wish I had started early when it came to networking to find a job/make contacts while I was an undergrad…. I felt a little betrayed by my schools career development office – but have realized that I am the only person that is 100% looking out for me and my career.” - Matt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What you’re seeing is the difference between what’s IMPORTANT and what’s URGENT. It’s always urgent to respond to that email, or to watch that TV show, or to do any of the 50 things we’re confronted with each day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But doing what’s important is difficult. Cultivating a network, discovering what we love, really connecting with family — these are things that are more important than any email. Yet we don’t do them because we will ‘get to it later”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can put off what’s important but not urgent for another day, then another and another. Pretty soon, 10 years have gone by and we’re in a similar job as yesterday. Or we’ve hopped from job to job, never really knowing what you want, how to find it, and how to feel connected to work you love. Some of us are even making 6 figures, but still not where we want to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;You Can Do More Than Regret&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s far more powerful to spend a week trying to meet with one person than a week trying to go to random networking events. In this case, “less is more” is true — it’s far more effective to focus and meet interesting, relevant people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top performers build their network BEFORE they need it. That’s how they can get laid off on a Monday and have a better job lined up by Friday. Read that sentence again, please — it means that top performers are comfortable meeting people and cultivating relationships with no specific purpose. In fact, the “reason” is almost always to help the other person!​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The First Steps Of Networking&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As humans it is very hard to reach out to people we do not know. Especially people we know . . . of, but that we don’t know well. Just remember, we all start as strangers. I’ve covered this important step in this LinkedIn Article. The bread and butter of networking is making introductions. It’s important to learn how to do it right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use a baseball analogy reaching out and getting introduced is like running. You will not get on base if you don’t run. Informational Interviews are first base. We’ve all heard about “informational interviews” but few of us do it. We are all swinging for a double, trying to land a job interview with a cold resume on a hot job listing.What is an informational interview? How does it work? And how can you use subtle techniques to make an informational interview help you — and more importantly, the other person — even if you have seemingly little to offer?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, an informational interview is an opportunity to meet someone you’re curious about and learn from them. Maybe you’re curious about their role. Maybe you’re curious about their company’s work culture. An informational interview allows you to find out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second, THIS IS NOT WEIRD. What’s weird is responding to a job listing with the written version of a cold call and waiting around for them to call you. Really?
Really. Informational interviews are powerful, yet because they seem “weird,” people don’t do them. Go ahead thinking they’re weird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next, people do not want to meet with idiots, which includes people who…&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask worthless questions
Ramble
Only talk about themselves
People WANT to meet with smart people. That means you, if you send a great email, have incisive questions, and are interesting. Let’s talk about what makes a great informational interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reach out through a warm contact. If you don’t have one, find one. The info is out there: Facebook, Twitter, blogs, the “Acknowledgements” page of their book, LinkedIn does a lot of this for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Explain any similarities you have. An alum reaches out who seems genuine? Who wouldn’t take a call or, if convenient, a coffee meeting. Maybe you grew up in the same town, or or are in the same LinkedIn Group.Reach out with a BRIEF, CONCISE EMAIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask insightful questions. GOOD: I noticed you did XYZ. It’s interesting because Very-Important-Person took a different approach and did ABC. What was your thinking? BAD: I’m so unhappy at my job. What should I do with my life? Ugh. Get a bowl of soup and a therapist. That’s not the kind of question you ask at an informational interview. Here is another great question, what can I do to help / support your business?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask questions for 90% of the informational interview, interjecting insightful comments once in a while, show you have done your homework. In the last 10%, mention what you are working on and ask for advice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never outright ask for a job, which you never, ever do in an informational interview. Always give an “out”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOTE: You don’t have to be socially smooth. Sometimes, awkward can be endearing! Not everyone is Rico Suave. But the very best show a remarkable level of preparation, which anyone can do — but few actually do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people stand out among the tens of thousands of others who leave comments/emails/tweets. Not only do the very best top performers have an uncanny ability to reach extremely busy people, but they can turn a one-time meeting into a long-term relationship. And over time, that is worth more than almost any technical skill or amount of experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;To Do Today&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow these steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm list of 10 people you’d like to connect with. Start with these people: People who have a job title you’re interested in learning more about. People who work at companies you’re interested in potentially working at. And people who are doing interesting things you want to learn more about (e.g., you read about them in a magazine/blog post).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Get their email address. If you can’t find this you fail at life. But you read this site so I suspect you’re cool. Use these scripts below for inspiration, or just use them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Set up Your Informational Interviews&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An informational interview is an opportunity to meet someone who works in a position or industry you’d like to work in, where you can ask them questions about their job and get the inside scoop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never, ever directly ask for a job in an informational interview. That’s a big no-no. You can turn an informational interview into a potential job opportunity, but only if you approach it wisely. Here’s the first step of that process: The email introduction for an informational interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the way, the best place to get informational interviews is via your alumni association. People who went to the same college have a bond with each other, even decades later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subject: BYU grad — would love to chat about your work at Adobe&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi Jane,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My name is Rho Lall. I’m a ’11 grad from BYU and I came across your name on the BYU Alumni Society group on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;#don&amp;#x27;tBeCreepy #tell&amp;#x27;emHowYouFoundThem&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;d like to get to know you better so that we both might benefit from being connected on a real level. Can we have a brief call to discuss how we can support one another.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to schedule a 20 - 30 minute discovery call go to this link to see my calendar and book a time that is convenient for you:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;https:calendly.com/rho/discovery-call&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I look forward to a meaningful discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thanks,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rho&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How To Ask For Recommendations For People To Talk To&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Question About [Potential Contact]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey John,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I reached out to [POTENCIAL CONTACT] at [COMPANY]. He is the [TITLE]. I am looking for opportunities as a business intelligence analyst and he is on my list of people I&amp;#x27;d like to network with. Is there a better person I should be reaching out to?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Do it!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You now have both the tactics (the scripts) as well as a strategic approach (narrowing down your networking, focusing on helping others, and understanding the power dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brainstorm 10 people you want to or should meet. Connect with them. Use the scripts above. Schedule and take the calls. Use the second script to ask for referrals for other informational interviews. Repeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Push the Button]]></title><description><![CDATA[

His justification, such criticism makes healthy discourse impossible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is an odd defense. The definition of healthy discourse is the ability to speak openly, even critically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with Spencer W Kimball, discussing his duty as a church leader to admonish others:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In writing about sin and repentance, no intent is implied that [I] or any of those quoted, except the Lord himself, is without fault. But we would not have much motivation to righteousness if all speakers and writers postponed discussing and warning until they themselves were perfected!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a juvenile belief that in order to have meaningful communication you cannot criticize. It is the antithesis of meaningful communication. In his seminal book, How to Win Friends And Influence People, Dale Carnegie offers this first principle, “Don’t criticize, condemn, or complain.” Sounds like Senator Paul, doesn&amp;#x27;t it? Only if you stick to headlines. The ideal Carnegie goes on to teach is to be kind, thoughtful, and considerate of others. Show respect to get respect. This principle encourages empathy when talking to other people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The adage Senator Paul used struck a chord for me: &amp;quot;Those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.&amp;quot; It&amp;#x27;s familiar. A less common but accurate meaning is: One who isn&amp;#x27;t open to criticism should not criticize. Senator Paul&amp;#x27;s takeaway: don&amp;#x27;t throw stones. President Kimball&amp;#x27;s takeaway: don&amp;#x27;t live in a glass house. Be open to criticism, or rather be mindful of your own imperfection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;d rather have Kimball on my team. I&amp;#x27;d rather have someone who is mindful of their own faults while striving to better all of us. Throw stones . . . gently.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Do You Work Too Hard?]]></title><description><![CDATA[
How do I deal with one thing after another blowing up in my face?

Stay late? Eat lunch at your desk? Check email from bed? Do you take a lunch only when you’re drowning and just need to get out of the office? Is a burger, fries and a shake a reward for a grueling morning? Have you ever said, “I don’t want to live like this. This isn’t me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have more than you can reasonably fit on your plate? Do you basically handle whatever falls off? But only if it explodes? If you have ever asked,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do I deal with one thing after another blowing up in my face?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need . . . something . . . because I am drowning. Wave after wave of work is knocking me down and the tide is coming in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve been there too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over a quarter of a professional’s working day is spent emailing. 28% is spent emailing and email is open the rest of the day in case something potentially explosive comes through:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A short reply from the boss, asking about that deliverable&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;An unhappy client&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Last week’s fire rearing its head, creating this week’s emergency&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study of employees at Cisco revealed that failing to respond to an email can lead to a swift breakdown in trust. Are you sitting on an unexploded time bomb?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The research: Major source of work related stress is the pull for timely response to emails.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is email killing you? That might read like hyperbole; read on and decide for yourself. A study of British civil servants found that the rank and file employees were at greater health risk than higher ranking administrators. Chronic stress was the culprit. These employees were accountable for outcomes where they had little authority, influence or control. Negative outcomes appeared, as if at random, outside of their control and influence. The result, chronic stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Often the sources of stress are small and varied, but chronic stress is linked to six of the leading causes of death, a slow death by a thousand papercuts. It’s not a huge leap to see that many of those small and varied stressors are coming from your inbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How does our work culture respond to this threat? Researchers have coined the term &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.wsj.com/atwork/2014/11/24/the-downside-to-speedy-email-responses-work-stress&quot;&gt;telepressure&lt;/a&gt; to describe the urge to respond immediately to email. I guess you can’t cure it ‘til you name it first. This urge includes thinking about emails that need to be written. As a result, says Larissa K. Barber, an assistant professor of psychology at Northern Illinois University, “You have trouble cognitively letting it go.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve been there. The research is helpful. But it only confirms I&amp;#x27;m not the only one that struggles with email, but that is not a solution. Managing email is a significant part of work. For my own sanity I went looking for a process to get my inbox under control because there had to be an easier way.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting Things Done.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of David Allen’s Getting Things Done? GTD for short. I’ve never read his book because my first exposure to his material was an MP3 download of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://store.gettingthingsdone.com/GTD-Live-p/20332.htm&quot;&gt;GTD LIVE Two Day Seminar&lt;/a&gt;. David Allen offers an &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/learning/getting-things-done&quot;&gt;introductory GTD course thru LinkedIn Learning&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an introduction to the theory and general practices. It’s not bad. But if you want to really master the skill, it will only get you started. You will need something else to get into the details and best practices. If $99 and two days is too much, an alternative is this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.udemy.com/google_gmail&quot;&gt;Inbox Zero course from Udemy&lt;/a&gt;. I like it because it is highly specific, actionable, and it’s video instruction. This course wasn’t around when I was figuring this stuff out, but this is exactly what I did in my gmail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GTD LIVE Two Day Seminar is fantastic! Skip the book. I highly recommend this seminar. At $99 it is pricy but, &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oBqOEtTA-lm9k0FMuCEiVk57HK1Co2ZCxyHa9YjzsGc/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;I have listened to it again and again&lt;/a&gt;. As David Allen says, the process is iterative. It isn&amp;#x27;t all or nothing. You can apply parts of it. You can learn, apply, and grow. Then repeat. I&amp;#x27;ve taken &lt;a href=&quot;(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oBqOEtTA-lm9k0FMuCEiVk57HK1Co2ZCxyHa9YjzsGc/edit?usp=sharing)&quot;&gt;a lot of notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Two Minute Rule&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest takeaways from David Allen is the two minute rule. Do anything that takes less than two minutes right away the first time it is in your face. It’s surprising how many things you put off that can get done in two minutes or less. For example, wash your dishes immediately after you eat, toss the laundry in the washing machine, take out the garbage . . . invest in yourself . . . invest in your time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buy the seminar. You have two minutes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Drip]]></title><description><![CDATA[

I read a lot in this space. The more I read the more I feel I need to read. It can be discouraging. It is easier for you to digest if you break it down into chunks. Here are four to start: building relationships, business acumen, self awareness, &amp;amp; organizational strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Building Relationships.&lt;/strong&gt; Do you want to be my friend? Sometimes that is all it takes. My kids do it all the time. Building leadership starts with positive and effective relationships. This is a core competency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business Acumen.&lt;/strong&gt; You need to be able to do something, attain goals with minimum guidance. Otherwise you are just hanging out. This includes the competencies of teamwork, performance &amp;amp; motivation. Although it also encompasses technical skills, managing work, and industry knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self Awareness.&lt;/strong&gt; Self awareness is the bud that flowers into leadership. If you think of these as stages then this is where a top performer starts to become a leader. That is why a lot of training starts here. Self awareness includes the competences of vision &amp;amp; values, sustainability, resilience, and emotional intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organizational strategy.&lt;/strong&gt; The ability to set the vision and direction for the long term success of the organization. Its comprised of the following competencies: political acumen, awareness. change, culture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;12 Core Competencies of Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Building Relationships&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Teamwork&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Performance&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Motivation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision &amp;amp; Values&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sustainability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Resilience&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Emotional intelligence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Political Acumen&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Awareness&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Change&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Culture&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s impossible to tackle all of them at once. That is the point of chunking it down. Pick one. Make a four to six week plan to focus on a skill in your chosen competency. Work to actively change your behaviors and habits. Habits drive change. It takes 4 to 6 weeks groove the behavioral and neurological pathways of the new habit you want to create. In a year to a year and a half you can make meaningful progress in each of the 12 competencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Some additional tips for developing leadership.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Create a masterminds group with professional peers. Focus: What is working? What needs improvement? Share challenges and successes. Support each other with suggestions, encouragement, ideas for improvement. Network to create mutually beneficial opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attend leadership development programs. Some ideas on where to look for programs: at work, local universities, non-profits, LinkedIn Learning, Coursera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Form a leadership development group. Read a book or take a course and come together to discuss implementing the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Data Driven Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why talk about leadership on a blog about data? We have not talked about data or decision making. I don&amp;#x27;t have a lot of time to write. I debated including leadership as a thread of this blog. I decided the topic merited inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These 12 competencies are inputs that go into decisions at an organizational level. To make the &lt;a href=&quot;(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo7cTcM9JjvtRUoTarvDCaBCVqb8KFlZDDAg9z2TvdY/edit#heading=h.hxpjzhd42hw8)&quot;&gt;best use of data a data driven organization&lt;/a&gt;, a data savvy manager, needs an understanding of leadership theory. The theory informs a leader of the right questions to ask when mining data. I&amp;#x27;ve taken some additional notes on these 12 competencies. I plan to flesh these out over time showing how they play a role in a &lt;a href=&quot;(https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qo7cTcM9JjvtRUoTarvDCaBCVqb8KFlZDDAg9z2TvdY/edit#heading=h.hxpjzhd42hw8)&quot;&gt;data driven organization&lt;/a&gt;.

In actuality the answer is, “well . . . sort of. Maybe. It’s more machine learning. At least some people think so.” The quick answer is that Business Intelligence is an evolving industry. If I get into it there is a variety of follow up questions that usually start: “What’s the difference between …”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the difference between business intelligence and machine learning? Even if you google these terms it’s hard to find a good definition. For sure you will find definitions, but not meaning and context for a never ending list of terms in a jargon rich field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quoting a Google employee, “Everything at the company is driven by machine learning.” What does that mean exactly? Is that big data? What about data mining? How does that fit in? Is this all just fancy jargon for old school econometrics and statistics?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the next 3 min i am going to take on the job of getting you up to speed on what all these terms mean in relation to each other. It isn’t enough to have a list of definitions, you need to understand context. That is what I will give you here. Context.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What Business intelligence is . . . and isn’t.
When you think about Business Intelligence you might confuse it for Business Analytics. Business Intelligence runs the business. Business Analytics changes the business. Intelligence directs process. Analytics directs strategy. Intelligence focuses understanding for today. Analytics focuses planning for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BI is real time access to data. Reporting. BI identifies current problems, solutions, and enables informed decision making. Business Analytics explores data: statistical analysis, quantitative analysis, data mining, predictive modelling among other technologies and techniques to identify trends and make predictions. But the two areas are merging as evidenced by these headlines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 Ways Machine Learning Can Make Your BI Better&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning: The Real Business Intelligence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning: The Future of Business Intelligence.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Big Data &amp;amp; BI Trends 2017: Machine Learning, data lakes, and Hadoop Vs Spark&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How Does  Machine Learning Relate to Business Analytics? What is it?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’ve heard machine learning described as the brains behind AI. Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives &amp;quot;computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.&amp;quot; I think of Machine Learning as a collection of pre-built algorithms for building models to predict future outcomes. Business analytics is about using those models on the execution side, putting insight into context and making things happen. In my last post I talked about the difference between data science and data savvy. Business analytics requires data savvy while machine learning is a component of data science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Data Science?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data Science deals with structured and unstructured data. In principle, everything that relates to data cleaning, preparation and analysis lies within the scope of Data Science. Data science is interdisciplinary requiring training in statistics, computer science, and industry. Solo practitioners with specialization in all three areas are rare so it is common to have data science teams: a data savvy manager, an econometrician, &amp;amp; a developer trained in machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional Research.&lt;/strong&gt; If you know anything about analytics (or statistics) you are probably familiar with regression: “ordinary least squares”. If not I highly recommend reading the book, Freakonomics. Regression is a mathematical way of drawing a straight line that most closely fits a scatterplot of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regression is the basis for econometrics which is squarely found in the arena of traditional research. Traditional research blends classical statistics with industry knowledge. The emphasis of traditional econometrics is to use statistical tools to determine causal relationships in data. An econometrician wants to be able to tell why something is happening in the data. They want to tell a story about why you see correlations. And they do that using different variations of the regression technique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software development.&lt;/strong&gt; We all have apps that make our lives easier &amp;amp; more entertaining. A relative few are lucky enough to earn a living developing and/or supporting software, SaaS (Software as a Service). Traditional software development makes processes more efficient. Most of development exists around this. This field requires both Computer Science (coders) as well as industry knowledge. This space is marked by partnerships between clients and their SaaS providers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers will spend a lot of time and resources understanding their client&amp;#x27;s existing process to build solutions around industry best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Machine Learning.&lt;/strong&gt; Which brings us back to machine learning, which is probably not as familiar as software development or traditional research. When a developer uses machine learning, what does that look like? It starts with a dataset. As is the case with traditional research the first step is to prepare the data for analysis. Data prep, munging or data wrangling, as it is called is the most time intensive step. The second step is to separate the data into two parts. Two thirds to 70% of the data is used for training the model. One third to 30% is saved for testing the model. A machine learning modeler has a variety of tools at their disposal to build a model of relationships based on the training data. The modeler will then make predictions about the test data based on this model. The more accurate the predictions, the better the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point you should have a clear idea of what data science is: a blending of machine learning, traditional research, and software development to create predictive models. To contrast BI focuses on dashboards and reporting for the here and now. BI focuses on process. DS focuses on strategy. Data science requires a variety of advanced skill sets which makes data science teams quite common (and full stack data scientists quite rare). Business analytics on the other hand requires data savvy: a survey level understanding of data science topics with the purpose of putting these models to good use by executing on business goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these topics a data savvy professional should be familiar with is an understanding of machine learning and the strengths and limitations of the more common algorithms used in machine learning. If you are interested in learning more, make sure to subscribe to my email list for data savvy professionals and get a copy of “Bull Doze Thru Bull.” In my next post we are going to explore these topics and get under the hood with machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Are You Indispensable?]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Every so often (when needed) I play hero. This feels like a hero moment. It&amp;#x27;s not. I actually under preformed because I was mugged. They took off with my time and focus. That is something to pay attention to. That is not sustainable. And it is definitely not scale-able. I am asking myself:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What just happened?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goal audiobook is playing in my head, “How can we double throughput?”
I have a theoretical throughput capacity. Individual heroism is great, but it doesn&amp;#x27;t scale. Neither do muggings. Like David Bowie says, &amp;quot;we can be heroes, just for one day.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For data to be useful track it consistently. Apples to apples indicates units as well. You can&amp;#x27;t track crates of apples if everyone else is tracking the actual apples. Data can identify economies of scale. Data can identify new opportunities but it helps if it is clean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goal audiobook is still playing in my head, &amp;quot;What can we do to double current weekly throughput in the future?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Load balance the week. If Mondays are particularly heavy ask yourself, what can wait for Tuesday? What can get shipped early? The Friday before? Shipping early is a big deal!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;How do you double throughput?
Double you ability to ship on any given Monday by load balancing to spread delivery across days. Track data consistently. Don&amp;#x27;t rely on heroes.If you want to better understand the principles I&amp;#x27;m using to construct these thoughts check out the Goal audiobook.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How Great Leaders Inspire Action]]></title><description><![CDATA[

But you can get away with just watching the TED talk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qp0HIF3SfI4&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/start_with_why_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;Start With Why&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone (and everyone) can tell you what they do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some can talk about how. This is 90% of what marketers will focus on: differentiating value proposition, proprietary process, secret sauce, or USP (unique selling proposition).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Very few people will talk about Why, Purpose, Cause, Belief. Why do you get out of bed in the morning? Why should anyone care? People don&amp;#x27;t buy what you do they buy why you do it. And the what serves as the proof of what you believe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe. It is not making money; that is a result. Start with Why, then follow it up with How and What.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;How to Start with Why​&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;​I bought Start With Why hoping to learn how to start with Why. It&amp;#x27;s a good read. I&amp;#x27;ve read and re-read it. The book comes up short at the end where Sinek up sells a $100 course to help you find your why. I opted to figure it out on my own. It took a little over a year to nail down a repeatable process. But it was free! If you are interested in learning how I did it, keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Articulating your Why is difficult. It&amp;#x27;s innately fuzzy. Your goal is to bring it into sharp focus. That might take some time. Just keep coming back to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My first attempts were heavily influenced by the Strengths Finder 2.0 Assessment. I highly recommend this assessment. It&amp;#x27;s free when you purchase the book, Strengths Finder 2.0. This is a great tool if you are looking for an objective measure of your innate strengths. Here is the catch, even as I explored my strengths I knew that strengths are not the same as purpose. This answers the question How, not Why. That is valuable, just not the final stop. Your strengths set you apart from the crowd, they are your USP, your secret sauce. So the exercise is worth taking the time to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s ironic that the question Simon Sinek leaves unanswered in his TED talk is answered by another TED talk: How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes by Adam Leipzig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVsXO9brK7M&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/life_purpose_video.png&quot; alt=&quot;How to know your life purpose in 5 minutes&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;m sure you have heard of the idea of an elevator pitch. Adam goes through a series of questions so you can articulate yours in under five minutes: your own elevator pitch that starts with why. You can check out mine on my LinkedIn Profile. Or my Instagram Bio. Even the intro of my Facebook page.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​But that is not going to be enough. It isn&amp;#x27;t going to weather the storm. And the storms will come. Believe that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What&amp;#x27;s It All For?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h6&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? Tour bus, studio, and the fans,&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? Chicks and whips with twenty inch rims,&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? To feed my family and my friends,&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6&gt;What&amp;#x27;s it all for? To change your world the best I can.&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;h6&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEk_XPY1sSg&quot;&gt;What&amp;#x27;s It All For&lt;/a&gt;, Bazaar Royal&lt;/h6&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final piece came after I read Mark Manson&amp;#x27;s The Subtle Art of Not Giving A F*ck. I think he is a terrific writer. He utilizes a strong voice (and language, consider yourself warned).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I could not have come across his book at a better time, it was actually one of the most awful times in my life. I was suffering from shouldy values. One in particular, which I&amp;#x27;ll call &amp;quot;big house nice car.&amp;quot; The house wasn&amp;#x27;t even that big, just bigger than mine. The car wasn&amp;#x27;t that nice, just nice to have. And somehow this justification made it less shallow. Have you ever heard someone say,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I&amp;#x27;m done with school . . . &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I get that internship . . . &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I graduate . . . &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I get a job  . . . &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;When I get a better paying job that is actually in my field . . . &amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Once I make X per year . . .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;. . . then I&amp;#x27;ll be happy / set / successful.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever heard those words? Was it you saying them? It was definitely me. These are dangerous words. They are a symptom of shouldy values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cure for shouldy values is to be mindful of great values. Your great values. Where I sit, people outsource this type of thinking to religion. Don&amp;#x27;t. For sure this is a great pool to draw from but, do your own homework. It&amp;#x27;s actually &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a fun exercise&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Cure For Shouldy Values​&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are going to fill out &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a bracket for your values&lt;/a&gt;. Think March Madness, but with values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#x27;ve started you off with &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wgq9x-iAZj5FDJJYSjsq9p_kAZH08HKT7WKyqBRlrGk/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;a pretty good list of values&lt;/a&gt;. Go through this list or feel free to google &amp;quot;list of values&amp;quot; yourself. Write down the ones that resonate with you on a post-it notes. One per note. Don&amp;#x27;t hold back, if a word catches your eye, write it on a post-it.​&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;​Don&amp;#x27;t skip this next step because if you do you will need to start over. You should have a pile of post-it notes now. Divide these post-its into categories: Personal Attributes, Activities, Relationships, Things, Skills. It&amp;#x27;s easiest to do this with Post-It notes. You might value certain categories more than others. It will become clear why this matters in the last step.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally you are going to fill your bracket. Hold a tournament (think March Madness) for each category. Each value is going to compete against another value. Consider a pair of Post-It notes. If you can only have one, which do you choose to keep? The keeper advances to the next round. Do this until you have a clear winner for each category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The categories are important because you might value one category over another. I found this was the case with me. Knowledge is one of my top values, but it is a thing and of all the categories I value things the least. Knowledge ended up getting killed by values in other categories. I saw it dropping down the ranks and knew something needed to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Which, brings me to the final step. The bracket is designed to spur your own intuition. It&amp;#x27;s not designed to be an objective measure. This isn&amp;#x27;t Highlander, there can be more than one. I actually created a top ten list for each category. You might even need different categories, if you do I&amp;#x27;d like to know about it. Really. Tell me. Please.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Tell Me Your Story.​&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;​Jamie Dimon once said, &amp;quot;Leadership is relentless storytelling. We all forget. We all need to be reminded of our purpose. So,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tell me your story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now that you have done all of this work,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;what story is yours to tell?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#x27;s a story about you, your tribe, and what you do for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It starts with what you believe, what you value. But it can&amp;#x27;t just be about you. Your story is about what you do to help your tribe to reach their ideal, achieve their goals, or overcome their trials. You need to be really clear about who you are, what you believe and how you stand out. You need to be clear so you can clearly communicate to your tribe. How else will they know? If they share your values then your Why will resonate with them. This is your contribution, what you do to serve them.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[What Makes The Difference]]></title><description><![CDATA[

It was a memorable lesson for me, and I hope you’ll get something out of it as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At BYU, it’s common for alumni to return as guest lecturers. In this case, one of the men in the story had returned to share his experience with us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story starts on a late spring afternoon, twenty-five years ago, the day two young men graduated from BYU. These men shared similar qualities. Both were better than average students, both were personable, both were returned missionaries, and both were filled with dreams and ambition for the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently, these two men returned to college for their 25th reunion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are still very much alike. Both happily married. Both have four children. And both, it turns out, work for the same bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there is one big difference between them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the men is a mid-level manager of a small department of that company. The other is president of his division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Made The Difference?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why was it that one of the men was a division president, and not just a mid-level department manager like the other? What makes this kind of difference in people’s lives? Do you wonder sometimes?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It usually isn’t just native intelligence, talent, or dedication. It definitely isn’t that one person wants success, and the other doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference lies in what each person knows, and how he or she makes use of that knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The man that became the division president simply made better decisions. Over time, that led to him getting more responsibility, and the status and pay that comes with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our world is filled with information, and almost everyone has access to it. Your ability to make sense of that data, and to use it to make good decisions, is the best way for your set yourself apart.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Why You Shouldn’t Grade Employees’ Performance on a Curve]]></title><description><![CDATA[

And if you have questions feel free to ask. Really.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are a couple additional power tips:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you remove the top ten percent of a power curve you are left with . . . a power curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means you can split power distributions into leagues. In middle school, for example, I was captain of the Jr. Varsity Soccer team. I could have played varsity (meaning I could have sat on the bench for the season). My coach knew I would rather play. I felt successful as captain because relative to my JV peers I outperformed. I was happier. I contributed more in the JV league then I would have in the varsity league. You can create similar results for your team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another point to consider, performance is dynamic. Take the time to find the areas where you outperform. Take the time to find the areas where your team member outperform. I&amp;#x27;d rather have a team of out-performers that excel across a variety of areas than a team of individuals competing against each other in one narrow area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you would like to better understand power curves, then check out, Bull Doze Thru Bull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can get it for FREE, just click here.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[I Got Fired because I made a huge mistake.

8 Lessons Leaned When I Lost My Job Because I Made A Huge Mistake.

The exec works at IBM. His boss is Tom Watson Jr, a leader of the information revolution. The issue at hand, a series of mistakes costing several million dollars. These mistakes led to him sitting across from Watson waiting for summary dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I suppose after that set of mistakes you will be wanting to fire me.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson’s response is now part of MBA cannon/lore:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Not at all young man, we have just spent a couple of million dollars educating you.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remember that the next time you make a mistake at work. But even if they fired you, the moral is to learn the lessons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;8 Lessons Leaned When I Lost My Job Because I Made A Huge Mistake.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of people get fired. Don’t feel bad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verify what legally happened. Employers will “lay off” employees to limit risk of wrongful terminations suits. It is also a pain in the ass that requires a lot of documents. If it comes up during the interview keep your answer brief and to the point: “I worked at (that employer) for X years. I was responsible for . . .”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ask for a letter of recommendation. It can hurt your pride, but not much else. A letter of recommendation makes calling for references unnecessary. If not from your supervisor, you can get them from other people in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Never lie to a prospective employer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With respect to Unemployment Insurance Benefits, do your homework. Rules and/or how they are carried out varies state to state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don’t be a victim. It takes two to tango. If your side of the story is a version of “It’s all their fault”, you are only fooling yourself. Advocate for yourself, by avoid blaming, and be objective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn from the experience. Take time for yourself to write down what you have learned from the experience. Share (even if it is only with yourself) the wisdom about yourself and your abilities that you have gained from this experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Remember, you are not Justine Sacco.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justine Sacco used to work as the PR Director for InterActiveCorp (IAC). In 2013 she tweeted to a following of under 200 people,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then she boarded her flight and turned off her phone for the eleven hour flight. When she turned it back on there was a message from her friend, “You need to call me right now! You are the number one world wide trending topic on twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Ronson does a fantastic job of telling her story:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/wAIP6fI0NAI&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://extra.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Jon-Ronson-August-Ames-Feature-Image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;One Tweet Can Ruin Your Life&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronson doesn’t finish the story. The story ends where it begun with the Gawker editor who first published Sacco’s tweet, Sam Biddle:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justine Sacco has a PR job she enjoys now, but she deserves the best and biggest PR job, whatever that may be. Give it all to her. Justine Sacco is the most qualified person in her entire field. She has the expertise of ten lifetimes when it comes to dealing with bad press. She survived a genuine personal crisis. She’s unkillable, and smart, and she will tell you to shut up, idiot, it can’t get any worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Learn from Justine.

We assume society is homogenous because pop culture places so much emphasis on the individual. But it’s not!

This research has been discussed over and over again: The Power of Habit, Linked: The New Science of Networks, &amp;amp; The Tipping Point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/g3bBajcR5fE&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://img.youtube.com/vi/g3bBajcR5fE/hqdefault.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Getting A Job with Social Networks&quot;/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The white collar workers in Granovetter’s study learned about new job opportunities through acquaintances, rather than close friends. Granovetter showed that weak contacts were twice as effective (28%) as strong contacts (17%) for finding a job. Casual connections were more likely to lead to a job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This seems counter-intuitive. On the surface it appears close friends would be better. But if you think about it, you interact with close friends on a regular basis. You consume similar media. By the time they have heard about a new opportunity, so have you. It’s your weak-tie acquaintances, i.e. rarely used gmail contacts, who can tell you about opportunities you would otherwise never hear about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While you process this uncommon sense here’s something else to consider. We assume society is homogenous because pop culture places so much emphasis on the individual. But it’s not! Sociologists have learned that society is made up of groups of people, clusters. Granovetter’s research shows these clusters are particularly important in channeling people into the best opportunities the economy has to offer. People trust and trust in people they know.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;75% of high end white collar jobs were found thru personal contacts or acquaintances, not close friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Take Away:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;(1) Send an email to someone you know (but don’t know very well) and check in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(2) Use Streak or hubspot, to track who opens your emails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;“But I don’t know what to say.”&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, you are overlooking the power of empathy. You bring value to the table because you understand and can share the feelings of those you connect with. Your job benefits other people, but have you lost sight of your human impact? It’s not the typical focal point of your work. There is value in the connection, but here are some ideas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Do any little thing that benefits them, not you.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Or just send them a link they might find useful.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Still stuck? Okay, send them the link to the post you’re reading right now.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If this has helped you it can probably help them too. 😉&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;One great idea is Adam Rifkin’s “Five-Minute Favor”: a favor that takes less than five minutes. Imagine taking a couple minutes every day to help someone in a way that’s a small commitment to you, but could be of large benefit to someone else.

It might be easier to draw the wind. The best I can do is is offer evidence it exists. I can’t articulate an answer, but I know it is there because I am inspired when I come to work and I am fulfilled when I leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wrote that a few months ago. I finished Simon Sinek&amp;#x27;s Start with Why. Twice. I look back at the progress I&amp;#x27;ve made. I’ve been working on something that I find inspiring. A mantra like
Elliot Hulse’s “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L241i4qX70M&quot;&gt;Becoming the strongest version of yourself&lt;/a&gt;
.” Or Eric Thomas’ “&lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/5fsm-QbN9r8?t=22&quot;&gt;When you want to succeed as badly as you want to breath, then you will succeed&lt;/a&gt;
.” The best I’ve got is, “Think into the deep thought.” &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s not intuitively clear. I suspect the vagueness is just cover for a thought that is still not clearly articulated. The idea is steeped in the idea that deep thought can only happen for a mind that is focused on the present. I’m all about deep thoughts. I ask myself, to what end? For the love of learning falls flat. The truth is because I want to learn. I want to know. It’s really just a fancy, enlightened way to say in my best Forrest Gump voice, “I like to learn a lot”. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight I broke through to the next level of clarity. Tonight I wrote:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Become a catalyst for change. Others might be intimidated by new knowledge, fear what they don’t understand.  But we can calm those fears and discover new understanding because we are willing to soak it in. Because we crave discovery.

Over the last few weeks when looking at the margins, i have only applied the most rudimentary planning in favor of completing work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, at the end of a short week, i am feeling the pressure of a shorter week.  I have items that need to get done. Some are rather large. However, I need to invest the time in communicating. There are a few takeaways that i want to remember here:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working 85 hours weeks is a symptom of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;poor planning&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;poor communication&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;poor stakeholder management&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;period.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cure is appropriate planning, tempered by marginal analysis of the trade off between planning and execution; ering on over-communication with a clear communication plan, &amp;amp; excellent stakeholder management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at my Asana, it looks like i havn’t done a full Weekly Review since 8/10.  That is almost a month. I’ve been more productive in this last month. I feel like I have been a lot more productive but, it has been at the expense of visibility, even my own. I don’t remember what all i did. I need a way to automate parts of my communication process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Learn (Not Just) a Language Quickly]]></title><description><![CDATA[

The book is an example-rich argument for innovating in a particular way—by deliberately experimenting and taking small exploratory steps in novel directions.
Some little bets will not pay off, of course, in which case little is lost; but others may pay off in big ways.
The point is that good ideas rarely emerge fully formed; rather they evolve in a discursive and unpredictable fashion.
Its claims are often attractive, but the analytical apparatus can be shaky: correlation is confused with causation; counter-evidence is ignored
(such as those who put down small bets but never enjoy large returns);
the role of circumstance or luck is underestimated; and some facts seem cherry-picked to push the message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reference: David A.

My thoughts and feelings on domestic policy relating to the underpinnings of republican economic thought and the quantitative support for policy decisions.
]]></description><link>https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/ai-strategy/naked-economics-fdr-vs-reagan</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://assumewisely.com/thoughts/ai-strategy/naked-economics-fdr-vs-reagan</guid><pubDate>Sat, 01 Aug 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In this entry I articulate my thoughts and feelings on domestic policy relating to the underpinnings of republican economic thought and the quantitative support for policy decisions.  I will discuss FDR’s ideas on the role of government in providing for the general welfare.  I will discuss Regan’s ideas on the same topic.  Finally, I will share a moderate position while reflecting on the ideas of both these men in light of my understanding of their enacted policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to “FDR, A Presidency Revealed”, FDR believed in enabling the American people to contribute to the labor-force and protecting the right to work.  He envisioned government programs would lay a strong foundation for the continuation of capitalism and the free market because he valued the American people’s contribution as a vital input in the means of production.  He redefined liberalism; pushing the limits of constitutional powers granted the federal government.  The judiciary pushed back, declaring the newly created NIRA unconstitutional.  FDR attempted to pack the court with sympathetic judges, but lost public support.  His positions also regularly clashed with conservative businessmen of the time.  As President, FDR felt it was his role to stand up and fight for the underdog, who in his eyes consisted of the professional working class.  In 1943, it was clear from FDR’s GI Bill of Rights that he was interested in shaping the society that American troops would come home to.  He did not want American heroes to come home to bread lines and soup kitchens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his 1944 State of the Union Address, FDR makes the argument that to obtain true individual freedom we need the addition of economic rights for the public.  He bases this argument on two assumptions.  First he assumes that “individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence.”  He supports this assumption as self-evident: “Necessitous men are not free men”; “people who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.”  Secondly, he assumes that the assurance of equality in the pursuit of happiness is not guaranteed by political rights.  These two assumptions are the foundation for his conclusion that his economic bill of rights will secure the missing foundations required for freedom and liberty.  He defends this ideology with an appeal to goodness:  “We cannot be content, no matter how high that general standard of living may be, if some fraction of our people—whether it be one-third or one-fifth or one-tenth— is ill-fed, ill-clothed, ill-housed, and insecure.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regan also valued the American people’s contribution to the free market.  He believed that people should be free to pursue their private interest and that government’s role is to support this function.  Regan championed the paradigm of supply side economics in the 80’s resulting in the portmanteau reganomics.  His domestic policy can be divided into three parts, each a core tenant of supply side economics: reduce income tax and capital gains tax, reduce government regulation, and reduce the growth of government spending.  Regan’s inaugural speech spoke to each of these tenants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lower taxes.  Regan argued that all of us together must bear the tax burden.  He stated that, “those who work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.”  This policy has its basis in the Laffer tax model.  Simply stated, at the extremes of a 0% and 100% tax rate the government would not collect any taxes; Laffer concluded that in-between there would be a positive amount of tax receipts and that mathematically there must be at least one maximum point with an associated optimal tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unregulated free trade and free markets.  Regan chided his opponents for their temptation in believing “that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule.”  He reasoned, “if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else?  In this area Regan relies on the principles of supply side economics which encourages individual initiative and entrepreneurship unfettered by government regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Privatization.  Regan argued that government, like a household,  should live within its means: “Why, then, should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation?  He believed in the private sector: “all must share in the productive work . . . and all must share in the bounty.”  Lastly, he channeled Locke’s ideas that our government has no power except that power that we give it.  He reminded the nation, “the Federal government didn’t create the states; the states created the federal government.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I don’t care much for political rhetoric.  I am more persuaded by quantifiable results.  For example, I am persuaded by the theoretical and social principles of supply-side economics.  The Laffer model makes logical sense.  However, these models simply lack the support of empirical data; attempts to estimate an optimal tax rate vary greatly (Hsing, Pecorino, Stuart).  For all his effort, FDR’s programs did not end the depression.  However, there is anecdotal evidence that they helped people facing difficult choices.[1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I agree with FDR that there are basic economic rights that need to be universally available.  First, it is my moral imperative.  Second, it is democratic.  Third, it is sound policy for the long term economic strength of the nation; I submit Bernake’s expertise on the Great Depression and his response to the great recession as evidence.  I believe in three of FDR’s economic rights: the right to a good education, the right to adequate medical care, and the right of every family to a decent home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, personal development and freedoms would be lost if the remaining rights enumerated in FDR’s Economic Bill of Rights could be demanded as a matter of right.  There is something to be gained in the pursuit of happiness; it is the equal opportunity of this pursuit that must be protected.  Conversely, I challenge his first assumption; there will always be a portion of society that exercises their freedom to be necessitous.  I submit this based on my experience working with the homeless population in New York City.  This idea balks at basic economic assumptions about material goods affect on utility and the nature of choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I identify with Republican ideas of fiscal and moral conservatism and I am concerned because the leadership doesn’t support the brand.  This is important because many voters use party affiliation to vet political candidates.  I am troubled by Regan’s deficit spending because it diverges from his political stance and I submit demonstrates a lack of integrity.  Republicans are branded as fiscally responsible but, deficit spending raises questions.  One question that I am now researching is if reganomics has subverted the economic landscape at the expense of small businesses and professionals in order to secure wealth in the hands of the few.  Evidence of this would support the spirit of FDR’s big government policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have touched on two points at the heart of my thoughts and feelings on spectrum of political ideas including those of FDR and Regan.  I would have liked to further explore the empirical evidence for supply-side economics as this is the basis for Regan’s policies.  As such, I have only included a high level summary.   I would also have like to develop a deeper exploration of Bernanke’s ideas on the great depression and how this informed his response to the financial crisis of 2008.  As such, this paper really only serves as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Work Cited&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDR: A Presidency Revealed. History Channel. Youtube, 2009.

The BI Triangle has the power to turn ordinary ideas into great fortune.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;./media/content/bi_triangle.png&quot; alt=&quot;BI Triangle&quot;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Questions to ask:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;How is it that you have so many businesses and other people can barely handle one?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How does your business grow while other people stay small?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;How do you have free-time when other business owners work constantly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Why do so many businesses start and then fail so quickly?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;why build a business?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive cash flow.&lt;/strong&gt; In his book How To Be Rich, J. Paul Getty states that his first rule is that you must be in business for yourself.
This allows them the free time and extra money to keep investing in more and more assets, more assets tax free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sell it.&lt;/strong&gt; For someone to be valuable, for something to be valuable, there must be many more people than you who want it.
If you can build a successful business, you will always have a lot money.
If you learn to build a successful business, you will have developed a profession that few people ever achieve.
As a business owner, you only need to get it right . .. once.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To build a business and take it public.&lt;/strong&gt; This was RD&amp;#x27;s idea of becoming an ultimate investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#x27;re never too old and you&amp;#x27;re never too young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The BI triangle outlines primary technical skills that are required as&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Vision: The ability to see what others cannot see. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Courage: The ability to act despite tremendous doubt.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Creativity: The ability to think outside the box.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability to withstand criticism: There is not one successful person who has not been criticized. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The ability to delay gratification: to be very disciplined, to learn to deny short-term and immediate self gratification in favor of a greater long-term reward.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mission:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A business can have both a spiritual and a business mission to be successful, especially at the beginning.
If the mission is clear and strong, the business will weather the trials every business goes through during its first 10 years.&lt;br/&gt;
When a business gets big and it forgets its mission, or the mission it was created for is no longer needed, the business begins to die.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people start a business only to make money...
The mission of a business should fill a need the customer wants. If fulfills that need well, the business will begin to make money.
When a spiritual mission and business mission are both strong and in mind, the combined power builds.
A mission must be preserved long after the entrepreneur is gone, or the business dies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Team&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many entrepreneurs, they&amp;#x27;ll really become business people, until after they leave their first business. Experience is a better teacher.
One of the first things to look at when evaluating a business, such as looking at a business to invest in or to buy stocks in, is the team running it.
One of the biggest problems businesses have is they personally lack experience and they have no team behind them, a team that inspires confidence.
For example, a business looking to go public should have someone on the team that has experience taking business public.&lt;br/&gt;
Looking at a business plan, one of the lines you should check is the line item under salary.
A high salary reveals an entrepreneur is not interested in creating a business but more creating jobs and lining their wallet.&lt;br/&gt;
As an investor, you should invest in management.  Not an idea.  You want to look for management team that has experience, passion and commitment.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons for creating CashFlow the board game is so you can learn to operate as a member of a team and as an individual.&lt;br/&gt;
Another thing to note, &amp;quot;money follows management&amp;quot;.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business is a team sport. Investing is a team sport.
In school, they train students to take tests on their own. If a child attempts to cooperate at that time, it&amp;#x27;s called cheating.
Rich dad would also say, in the real world, that there&amp;#x27;s not business owners cooperate at that time, and in the world of business, every day is test time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Important lesson: People in the E and S quadrant often make less money they could or would like to, because they attempt to do things on their own.
Especially those in the E quadrant, they form a union, instead of a team.
There&amp;#x27;s a perfect example of an individual trying to trade against the well organized team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The people who want to become sophisticated investors and above must invest as a team.&lt;br/&gt;
On Rich Dad&amp;#x27;s team, we are accountant attorneys, brokers, financial advisors, insurance agents, and bankers.
When I was first starting out, I dreamed of having my own team of accountants and attorneys, not a boat.
My CPA was minding about 30 other businesses on that day alone.
In comparison, I could see a team of people working only on Rich Dad&amp;#x27;s business.
In the working areas, his office was a row of bookkeepers, about 14 of them.
Five full time accountants, chief financial officer. He also had two full time attorneys working for him in his main office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I said, most people work hard, and dream of getting away on their boat.
I first dreamed of having a team of full time accountant and attorneys.
That is why I could now have a big boat, and the free time. A matter of priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Natural Tetrahedron&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;A team forms a natural tetrahedron. A natural tetrahedron has the nature comprised of air, fire, earth, and rain.&lt;br/&gt;
Each person tends to be weighted predominantly in one of these elements, although we all have some part of each of the four.&lt;br/&gt;
If you only put two elements together, as in a partnership, you get some strange phenomena:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air and water equal spray.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Air and earth equal dust.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Water and earth equal mud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Earth and fire equal lava and/or ash.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fire and water equal steam.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fire and air equal flame.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;People came and went until the right tetra-team finally locked into place.  Once this stabilized, it begins to radiate out, growing rapidly and with stability.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Leadership&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troops do not follow a leader who does not lead.
The most important quality of a leader is trust.
A leader&amp;#x27;s job is to bring out the best in people, not to be the best person.
If you are the smartest person on your business team, your business is in trouble.
Volunteer more... at your Church, take on projects.  At work, volunteer to lead projects.
A Leader&amp;#x27;s roles are a combination of:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Visionary.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Cheerleader.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Pit boss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a visionary, the leader must keep his or her focus on the corporate mission.&lt;br/&gt;
As a cheerleader, he or she must inspire the team as they work together toward that mission, as well as herald success along the way.&lt;br/&gt;
Pit boss, he or she must be able to make tough calls regarding issues that distract the team from achieving the mission,
to take effective action while maintaining focus.&lt;br/&gt;
With the right mission and team, you are well on your way to building a strong business.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Answers from a life coach: What do you do for a living?]]></title><description><![CDATA[

keep every word relevant.  Two powerful lines are better than half a page of waffle.  Of course, keep it honest.

As always, you decide what is authentic, and what isn&amp;#x27;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your background and training are close to coaching, you can mention how it was a natural progression.  If they are completely at odds with coaching, you can mention why you&amp;#x27;ve made such a switch before you begin the exercise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;List the top 10 reasons someone should hire you, what are your strengths?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;List everything you can think of that you have done in your life, including training, experiences, insights.  Cross out anything that doesn&amp;#x27;t add to your credibility or express who you are.  Suggestion: check with a fellow coach on this.  Make sure you&amp;#x27;re not throwing out valuable information that you are blind to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Write a half-page bio, then go through and cut it down to two or three paragraphs that really describe you well.  Search the internet and print off three bios that sound attractive to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have a friend who is good with words or marketing edit it to give you a bio that sounds great.  A great sounding bio can make an amazing difference to your confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Run your bio past three friends or colleagues who you would like to coach, and that represent your target market.  Use their feedback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Put your bio on your website in a handy, electronic file, where you can easily find it to insert into an e-mail or to forward to prospective clients or audiences.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ten Reasons to Become a Coach]]></title><description><![CDATA[

Then there is the potential for referrals, free training, more and more confidence with every session that you do.
Lastly, possible revenue either immediately or down the road.
In the extreme, if you have 20 pro bono clients you would attract more clients and feel very comfortable charging them your full feel.
Once you have 10 to 20 clients, with the assistant of a mentor coach, your practice will naturally grow in number of those clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Client retention and income.&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have saved some clients, you might begin to look longer term, sustainable marketing method.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What is Coaching&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coaching involves holding out a possibility in front of others, while coaching them to move to the next level with relentless compassion. Coaching people to unleash their aspirations beyond what they already seem to know and maximize the results is one of the highest aspirations of what it is to be human. Hargrove 2000, there seems to be more to this whole living thing than meets the eye. Coaching is essentially a conversation between a coach and his/her client. Starting with the aim of helping the client live a fulfilling life:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Set Goals:
Achieve those goals:
A coach with also provide access to ideas the client may already have but is not aware of.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;B. Clarity around what the client actually wants.
C. Sounding board.
D. Support in big decision making.

F. Direction in times of confusion.
G. Brain storm to flesh out ideas.
