According to Covey, expressing your voice is a key to lifelong holistic success.

At the time I thought, maybe when I'm 40, I'll have something useful to share. Well, now I do.

Be mindful of when the chapters end. Take a beat. Summarize the lessons learned. Write it down. This is not the same as journaling which is capturing the experiences of the day. Journaling has its value: by all means, journal. But know that the real value is in the stories that leave an impression on your soul. What memories form the cornerstone of your character. What is remarkable? What should be remembered? What is useful? What do you want to pass on? To answer these kinds of questions a little distance is helpful.

It’s kept me from publishing. It's only natural to feel concerned. It's reasonable to expect judgment on my thoughts and how well I express them. My writing is a reflection of me.  I’ve found that when I cringe, it's actually evidence I’ve progressed as a writer. There is a delta between where I was as a writer and where I am today. I remind myself, I can always re-write.
